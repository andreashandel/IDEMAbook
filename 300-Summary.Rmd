# Summary

This book provided an introduction to Infectious Disease Epidemiology from a modern, dynamical systems perspective. 

While the ability to be able to develop and analyze dynamical models requires additional training and skills in mathematics and coding, I hope that this book helped you to understand such a systems modeling perspective and different ID concepts best discussed from such a perspective.
