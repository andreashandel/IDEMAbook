#Stochastic Dynamics and Extinctions

##Overview and Learning Objectives
In this module, we will take a look at stochasticity and how it impacts ID dynamics. A special focus is given on the potential of ID extinction. We will discuss how one needs to account for stochasticity in models if one wants to study extinction. We will then investigate the phenomenon of extinction and then turn to the flip side, emergence of new pathogens through evolution. 


The learning objectives for this chapter are:

* Understand how stochasticity affects ID dynamics and can lead to extinctions
*	Understand the difference between stochastic and deterministic models
*	Know when one needs to make use of stochastic models
*	Understand the concept of critical community size


##Determinisic models
So far, all the models we have used to explore different aspects of ID dynamics have been _deterministic_. For a deterministic model, once you choose the initial conditions and parameter values, you always get the same result, no matter how often you run the model. There is no randomness present.

Such deterministic models are fairly easy to implement and to study. That is one reason why they are often used. Such a modeling approach also often provides a good representation of the dynamics of real ID if numbers are large. That is due to the law of large numbers. While every individual host or pathogen undergoes somewhat random dynamics, these random parts get _averaged out_ and the dynamics for the whole population is fairly predictable and well described by such deterministic models. (This is the same concept we use in classical epidemiological studies, where we enroll large enough numbers such that we can say something predictable about differences between groups, even if individuals are somewhat unpredictable.)


##Stochasticity
Biological systems are never deterministic. When numbers are low, randomness starts to matter. As an example, consider an outbreak of some ID. Let's say we have a group of 100 infected. At a given time, some of them will transmit to others and after that they will recover from the disease, while others will recover before being able to further infect others. The overall outbreak dynamics can be well approximated by a deterministic model if we properly specify the average rate of transmission and the average rate of recovery. In contrast, now assume that there is a single infected person. It makes a huge difference if this person first transmits to someone else before recovering, or if they recover before further transmitting. In the latter case, the outbreak is over and the ID has gone extinct. Thus, at low numbers, randomness/unpredictability in the order of events can make a large difference. 


##Discrete numbers and Extinctions
Another problem inherent in the deterministic differential equation based models we have looked at so far is that they treat individuals in each compartment as continuous. The models allow for instance 142.7 infected hosts. Of course, in reality those numbers have to be integers. If we are dealing with large numbers, this difference between 142.7 and 142 or 143 is minor and doesn't matter. However, once numbers get small, the fact that we are dealing with discrete numbers of hosts matters. Most importantly, if less than 1 host is infected, it means in reality the ID is gone. A continuous model would instead allow the number of infected to drop below 1 but still remain above 0. In this way, the ID in the continuous models never goes truly extinct, it only gets closer and closer to 0 (and at some point is so close to 0 that the computer can't distinguish it from 0 anymore).

##Modeling Stochasticity and Extinction
To capture both the randomness and discrete nature of real systems, a slightly different modeling approach is needed. We can still use compartmental models, i.e. we track total numbers of individuals in specific states (e.g. S-I-R). But now, instead of letting the numbers in each compartment change continuously through inflows and outflows, changes happen in discrete steps, determined by specific events that occur in a probabilistic manner. 

As an example, instead of new susceptible hosts entering the system at some continuous birth rate, we now model births occuring as discrete events. Each birth event leads to an increase in the number of susceptibles by 1. 
The timing of the birth events is somewhat random, with overall probability determined by the model (e.g. a higher birth rate will mean births occur more frequent, but still randomly.)


##Factors affecting extinction
Extinction of ID is of interest because that is often our final goal. We would like to drive an ID to extinction, either locally or even better, globally. If and how an ID can be driven to extinction depends on different factors. First, for human ID, the only real chance is to tackle IDs for which there are no other hosts. As such, we will likely never be able to eradicate influenza. But measles eradication might be possible (though hard).

Several factors influence the likelihood of an ID to go extinct. The size of the host population and speed at which resources (i.e. new susceptible hosts) are replenished are important factors. So are the infectiousness of the ID, the duration of the latent and infectious periods, the ability of the ID to persist outside the host, etc.


##Critical community size
The minimum size of a population at which an ID can maintain itself in a population without extinction has been termed Critical Community Size (CCS) (this also depends on the replenishment of new susceptibles, e.g. birth rates). Studies for measles suggested that the CCS was several hundred thoushand [@keeling02], meaning that measles could have only become a human pathogen once human populations were large enough to maintain the ID. The CCS is with reference to the susceptible population. Thus, it is possible to reduce a community size by for instance vaccinating. That means that to get an ID to go extinct, it is not necessary to vaccinate everyone. We just need to reach enough individuals to get the population of susceptibles below the critical level. This task is already hard by itself, as evidenced by the fact that we have not been able to eradicate measles, despite having a good vaccine.


##Host extinction
Another way an ID can go extinct is if its hosts go extinct - either due to mortality from the ID or other causes. 
For most human diseases, such host extinction is fortunately not very common - though highly lethal ID such as Ebola can lead to marked reduction in the number of hosts in a given population. For non-human disease, extinctions of hosts due to disease is a more important issue. Here, conversation efforts might try to achieve non-extinction of the host and - ideally - extinction of the ID.
