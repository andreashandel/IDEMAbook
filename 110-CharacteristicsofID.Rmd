# Characterizing Infectious Disease States


## Overview and Learning Objectives
In this module, we will discuss ways to characterize individuals with regard to their ID status. We will consider why some infection states are important for public health control but less for doctors and the opposite. We will also discuss how different ID states might or might not correspond to the compartments in our computer models. 


The learning objectives for this chapter are:

* Categorize infectious diseases according to medical characteristics such as duration of symptoms, mortality, etc.
* Categorize infectious diseases according to public health characteristics such as duration of infectiousness, immunity, etc.
* Understand how "medical states" (e.g. symptoms) and "public health states" (e.g. infectiousness) do not always overlap.
* Identify the features of infectious diseases that are most important to know for successful intervention planning
* Understand how models change as more details are included

##Introduction
We previously introduced a very simple compartmental systems model for an infectious disease (the SIR model) where individuals were split according to 3 states: susceptible, infected (and infectious) and recovered (and immune). While easy and sometimes a good starting point, the simple SIR is often not detailed enough to capture the important aspects of many infectious diseases. Here, we discuss some important considerations with regard to the infection status of individuals that can affect the behavior of the system and thus need to be included if one wants to build a model to study this system.


## Infection states 
It is important to keep in mind that infectiousness and symptoms are not always overlapping. The former is the most important driver of the ongoing infection process. The latter is important for surveillance and medical interventions. We will discuss different clinical/medical and epidemiological/transmission states in the following.


### Infection states - clinical
From a purely medical perspective, focusing on one patient at a time, the most important characteristic of a disease is its severity, also called morbidity. We would like to know what kind of symptoms a disease produces and how frequently those occur. This is the morbidity profile of a disease. One can consider mortality the "ultimate symptom". Because of its importance, mortality is often considered separate from morbidity. Knowing morbidity and mortality of an ID are generally most important when caring for individual patients. For interventions, understanding what might help mitigate morbidity and mortality is of prime interest. Morbidity and mortality are also often necessary for the acquisition of data. It is difficult to determine infected individuals that do not show symptoms, those that are symptomatic - and obviously, those that die - are easier to count and thus get estimates for disease prevalence and incidence.


###Infection states - epidemiological
From the perspective of a public health practitioner, other ID characteristics besides morbidity and mortality are fundamental. We need to know when someone is infectious (e.g. before/without symptoms, or only when symptomatic), how transmission occurs, if recovered individuals become immune, if immunity is waning, etc. The difficult part is that our data often comes from clinical (symptomatic) cases or deaths. If asymptomatic individuals are infectious, or there is underreporting, we often don't get the full picture. 

Of course, the medical and epidemiological perspectives are not an 'either/or'. Instead, success in combating infectious diseases only comes when all aspects are considered. Still, it is useful to keep in mind that certain infection states are more important when considering how to intervene on the individual patient level versus intervention on a population level.


#### Biased Surveillance - an example {#myexamplebox}
During the early days of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the numbers on cases and deaths suggested that this strain of influenza might have a higher than normal case fatality ratio (the often used term case fatality rate is a bad label as this is not a rate). Once more and better data became available. It was realized that many infections initially did not get reported, and adjusting for those it became clear that the ratio of deaths to infected was thankfully not much different from seasonal influenza.

##Other important infectious disease stages
In addition to the infection stage, other states of the host might need to be considered carefully. For instance, while in the classic SIR model the recovered individuals are assumed to be immune to re-infection - and thus don't further influence the systems dynamics, there are IDs which either do not induce immunity (e.g. many sexually transmitted diseases) or only lead to short-term immunity (e.g. norovirus or influenza). This can often be represented in a model by adjusting the flows, e.g. if recovered individuals initially have some immunity and then lose them, flow from the recovered to the susceptible class can be implemented.

###Models with more details
To study the dynamics of an infectious disease in more detail than is provided by the simple SIR model, we can consider models that allow for additional states. Figure \@ref(fig:complicatedmodel) shows a model with additional compartments. Equations for this model are not shown here, but a model similar to this one, together with the equations, can be found in the corresponding DSAIDE app referred to below.

##How complex should our model be?

Individuals can be classified as non-infectious or infectious. The latter could be divided further, e.g. into low and high infectiousness. Infectiousness is the primary driver of the dynamics. Clinical states that are often tracked are asymptomatic, symptomatic and dead. Sometimes, individuals are asymptomatic before they become symptomatic. This is usually labeled pre-symptomatic. Individuals in any of those states can be infectious or not. Depending on the ID, some of those states are more important than others. For instance for HIV, individuals are infectious during the long asymptomatic period, while asymptomatic individuals infected with TB are not infectious. A model describing a specific system needs to be tailored to the ID under study. 

The question then becomes: What details should we include and which ones should we omit? We can - and do not want to - include every detail of a complex system, i.e. all components and interactions. We need to decide which parts are important and need to be in the model, and which ones we can ignore. A simple and somewhat silly example: We never include the hair color of individuals in any infectious disease models (at least I've never seen such a model), since we assume that this characteristic is not important for the ID dynamics. The choice to include or exclude other features is less obvious in other cases. For instance, for an HIV model, we likely need gender, while a SARS model might ignore this characteristic. 

In general, we need to decide for a specific ID, scenario, and question which details to include in our model and which ones to ignore. In general, the primary interactions between components of the system are needed. Thus, if we wanted to model the transmission dynamics of Ebola, we might need to include deceased infected individuals into the model, since they are known to contribute to transmission. In contrast, if we want to study how some control strategies for SARS might reduce the total number of *infected* but we don't care about the impact on total deaths (unlikely, but let's just pretend). In this case, we would not need a dead compartment in our model, since those dead don't further interact with anyone else in the system. However, if we want to keep track of deaths and how they are impacted by our intervention (likely), we do need to track them - even though dead people are not known to transmit SARS. 

We will see many different types of models as we go through the course. In general, the models will include the feature we are focusing on while excluding others. For instance, we might include human and mosquitos for vector-borne IDs but ignore things like asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic states. This is mainly done to keep models simple and focus on one feature at a time. Models that address "real" questions often -- but not always -- include a fair number of details.

To build models that are suitable to study a particular system, model builders need to be experts on the system they want to study and/or collaborate with subject matter experts. 

Building a good model needs to follow the [Goldilocks Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle): If a model is too small/simple, it likely doesn't approximate the real system very well. If the model is too big and complicated, it 's hard to build, hard to analyze, prone to mistakes, and might not lead to much insight (i.e. the model is a big black box). The goal is to get the model _just right_ regarding size and complexity. Unfortunately, no recipe or formula exists specifying how to build a _just right_ model. Being able to build models that are appropriate/suitable for a given ID and question distinguishes good modelers/scientists from less good ones.

Also, the model building and analysis process is often iterative. After a model has been built and studied, it might become clear -- e.g. by comparing the model with data -- that important components or interactions have been ignored or not been included correctly. This leads to model modification and refinement. This back and forth between model and data/the real world can happen over multiple iterations.



##Summary and Cartoon
This chapter discussed ways to characterize an individual host's state with regard to an infection. We discussed the differences between medical and public health perspectives and how ID states can be mapped to models. We also briefly discussed how one should build models that provide the right amount of complexity.

##Exercises
* The _Characteristics of ID_ app in the DSAIDE package provides hands-on computer exercises for this chapter.
* Suggest a real ID that might be approximately described by the _Characteristics of ID_ DSAIDE app. Approximately what values for the different parameters would be appropriate to describe the ID you have in mind? See what you can find for the different parameters of the ID you chose in the literature.
* Read the paper "Modelling an outbreak of an emerging pathogen" by Kajita et al [@kajita07]. The paper lists 8 assumptions that went into constructing the model. Is there any assumption that you might have made differently, and why? Are there other assumptions the authors make when building the model that are not included in their list of assumptions? If your next step would be to further increase model realism, what would you do, i.e. what feature(s) would you include that are currently not in the model?



##Further Resources
* The following papers provide some additional information on the ideas discussed in this chapter: [@fine03; @milwid16].
* A good example showing how different assumptions about ID states can lead to different conclusions, and how models can be used to discriminate between alternate hypotheses can be found in [@king08].
