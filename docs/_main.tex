\chapter{Overview of this book}\label{overview-of-this-book}
>>>>>>> master

This book discusses infectious disease epidemiology by taking a
\emph{(dynamical) systems approach}.

\hypertarget{rationale-for-this-book}{%
\section{Rationale for this book}\label{rationale-for-this-book}}

Infectious disease epidemiology is the oldest area of epidemiology and
public health. As such, it is well studied, often taught, and good
resources exist. So why another book on that topic?

While there are plenty of infectious disease epidemiology books that
cover the topic from a classical epidemiological perspective, such an
approach often ignores or minimizes the importance of interactions.

On the other side, the well-developed field of infectious disease
modeling has its main focus on studying the interactions and resulting
dynamics of ID. Good text books exist, such as (Anderson and May
\protect\hyperlink{ref-anderson91}{1991}; Diekmann and Heesterbeek
\protect\hyperlink{ref-diekmann00}{2000}; Keeling and Rohani
\protect\hyperlink{ref-keeling08}{2008}; Vynnycky and White
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vynnycky10}{2010}), but require a strong
quantitative and mathematical background from the student.

This book is intended to fill the gap. Infectious disease topics are
discussed from a \emph{dynamical systems perspective}, but without a
strong emphasis on teaching modeling - though we believe any modern
infectious disease epidemiologist needs to have some familiarity with
models, and as such, this book contains models and equations - but does
not try to teach the student to become a modeler, instead the focus is
on understanding the modeling perspective and becoming an \emph{educated
consumer} of models.

\hypertarget{what-this-book-does-and-does-not-cover}{%
\section{What this book does and does not
cover}\label{what-this-book-does-and-does-not-cover}}

This book does not teach basic concepts of epidemiology. We assume
readers are familiar with basic ideas such as incidence and prevalence,
basic study design such as cohort and case-control studies and clinical
trials, and other basic epidemiological concepts. For readers unfamiliar
with these ideas, we suggest e.g. (Giesecke
\protect\hyperlink{ref-giesecke17}{2017}).

This book does also not teach much about specific infectious diseases.
While many different infectious diseases appear in this book, the goal
is not to describe any one in much detail. Instead, they appear as
examples of general dynamical patterns and concepts the book covers. For
information on the epidemiology of specific infectious diseases, good
resources are e.g. (Nelson and Williams
\protect\hyperlink{ref-nelson13}{2013}).

Finally, while this book takes a modeling perspective, it does not
intend to teach modeling. For anyone interested in learning how to build
and analyze their own infectious disease models - a skill we highly
recommend learning - we suggest e.g. (Keeling and Rohani
\protect\hyperlink{ref-keeling08}{2008}; Vynnycky and White
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vynnycky10}{2010}).

Maybe the material closest in approach to this book is not another book
but the online course ``Dynamics of Infectious Diseases'' developed and
taught by multiple faculty members at Penn State University and hosted
on Coursera (State \protect\hyperlink{ref-epimooc}{2014}). This course
is free to take, and I can strongly recommend it. Another online course
that has been offered in the past through edX is ``Epidemics'' from Hong
Kong University (University \protect\hyperlink{ref-hkepidemics}{2015}).

\hypertarget{how-to-use-this-book}{%
\section{How to use this book}\label{how-to-use-this-book}}

Each chapter deals with a different topic concerning infectious diseases
and their dynamics at the population level. While I assume that the
reader goes through the text linearly, and therefore occasionally
reference topics discussed in previous chapters, it is likely possible
to read the chapters out of order and as needed refer to previous
sections to the book if they are mentioned.

The idea is that this material can be learned without the need to rely
on advanced mathematics or computer modeling. That said, this book still
contains models and equations. In the case where this material is
advanced, it is placed in a special text box. It is possible to skip
over those boxes and still follow everything else.

\hypertarget{computer-exercises}{%
\section{Computer exercises}\label{computer-exercises}}

Modern infectious disease epidemiology is inherently computational. As
such, models feature prominently in this book. As a complement to this
book, I wrote a user-friendly R package, DSAIDE, which allows the reader
to explore and further learn all the topics discussed in this book
through hands-on computer exercises. These computer exercises and the
use of the DSAIDE package do not require coding skills. At the end of
each chapter, I mention which simulation/app from the DSAIDE package
corresponds to the material covered in the chapter. For an overview and
introduction to the DSAIDE package, including how to install it and get
started, please read (Handel \protect\hyperlink{ref-handel17}{2017}).

\hypertarget{recommended-complementary-resources}{%
\section{Recommended complementary
resources}\label{recommended-complementary-resources}}

Each chapter of the book lists additional and complementary resources
for specific topics. As overall supplements to this book, I specifically
recommend the following resources:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The online courses ``Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases''
  (State \protect\hyperlink{ref-epimooc}{2014}) and ``Epidemics''
  (University \protect\hyperlink{ref-hkepidemics}{2015}).
\item
  For additional information on infectious disease epidemiology from a
  more traditional, medical perspective, the very detailed book
  ``Infectious Disease Epidemiology'' is a good reference (Nelson and
  Williams \protect\hyperlink{ref-nelson13}{2013}).
\item
  For those who want to continue learning about infectious diseases and
  modeling with the goal to become modelers, I recommend ``Modeling
  Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals'' (Keeling and Rohani
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-keeling08}{2008}) and ``An Introduction to
  Infectious Disease Modelling'' (Vynnycky and White
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-vynnycky10}{2010}).

\section{Overview and Learning
Objectives}\label{overview-and-learning-objectives}}

In this chapter, we discuss the idea of taking a \emph{dynamical systems
approach} and how it is applied to infectious diseases.

The learning objectives for this chapter are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Understand the basic ideas of complex systems and systems thinking
\item
  Understand how models can help study complex systems
\item
  Assess strength and weaknesses of different modeling approaches

  Understand the concept of a compartmental model and how it can be used
  to model infectious diseases
\end{itemize}

\#\#Introduction The scientific approach that has generally been the
most successful in the past was to break down a system into its
components and study the components one at a time. This is commonly
referred to as the \emph{reductionistic approach}. This approach to
understanding the world is still very powerful and useful.

A complementary approach, which has seen increased use, is to look at
all components of a given system at once, instead of each component by
itself. Using the whole system approach can provide insights that might
not be obtained by the purely reductionist approach. Looking at the
whole system at once is often referred to as \emph{systems
thinking/approach}.

While the terminology of \emph{systems thinking} or \emph{systems
approach} has seen increased use in the last few decades, the general
idea has been around for a while. The notion of systems is present in
virtually every field of research, ranging from the hard sciences to
social sciences and business. In public health, there is the basic idea
- most often applied to infectious diseases - of the \emph{agent - host
- environment} system, also referred to as the \emph{epidemiological
triangle} (Figure \ref{fig:epitriangle}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/epi-triangle.png}
\caption{\label{fig:epitriangle}A system perspective - The epidemiological
triangle}
\end{figure}

\#\#Systems Thinking The term \emph{systems thinking} or \emph{systems
approach} is not a very clearly defined term, but in general, a
\emph{systems} perspective looks at multiple - often many - components
that interact with each other in potentially complicated ways.

For instance, the problem of obesity has many different components that
interact in potentially complex ways to affect a person's weight. Figure
\ref{fig:obesitysystem} illustrates this, see also for instance
\href{https://youtu.be/2vojPksdbtI}{this video}. Complex systems are
everywhere. The approach of studying (most of) the system at once
instead of looking at a single component at a time is the hallmark of
the \emph{systems approach}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/complexsystem.png}
\caption{\label{fig:obesitysystem}Obesity as a complex system:
\url{http://goo.gl/m2Qq13}}
\end{figure}

\#\#Systems Thinking and Models Once we take the systems perspective, we
have to deal with many components that interact in potentially
complicated ways. This makes study and analysis complicated, especially
if we are trying to gain insights into the causal and mechanistic
connections between system components and their effect on outcomes of
interest. While a qualitative, conceptual model (e.g.~the one shown in
Figure \ref{fig:obesitysystem}) often provides some qualitative
understanding, it is limiting. It is for instance almost impossible to
gain a good \emph{quantitative} understanding how changes in certain
conditions and components of a system lead to changes in outcomes of
interest by relying on conceptual approaches alone. If we want to go
beyond qualitative and move toward a quantitative understanding (i.e.
`increasing the tobacco tax by X\% will reduce smoking-related health
care costs by Y\%'), we need quantitative, i.e.~mathematical or
computational, models. There are many different types of such models one
can use. The following provides a - very brief - overview of different
modeling approaches.

\#\#\#Phenomenological (statistical) Models A huge class of models
consists of what is usually refered to as statistical models. In the
context of this discussion, I prefer to label them
\emph{phenomenological} models, but that terminology is rarely used. The
idea behind the statistical/phenomenological approach is to use a
mathematical or computational model to study if there are any patterns
between the components of the system and the outcomes of interest.

For instance, a linear regression model investigates if there is a
pattern between input (system components or other measurable quantities
that are part of the system) and an outcome of interest that can be
approximated by a linear function. More complicated statistical models
exist, some go by the name of \emph{machine learning methods}. All of
these models try to determine if there are patterns between inputs and
outputs of interest in the data. Some of the more complicated models
allow for interactions between system components (inputs, predictors,
variables). Figure \ref{fig:phenomodel} gives an illustration of 2
simple phenomenological models fit to some data.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/phenomodel.png}
\caption{\label{fig:phenomodel}Two phenomenological models, a linear and
quadratic equation, fit to data. The data and model suggest that there
is a clear pattern of decreasing fuel efficiency as engine size
increases. It seems the pattern is somewhat better described by the
quadratic model.}
\end{figure}

One feature these phenomenological models have in common is that they do
not try to describe the \emph{mechanisms} of interactions within the
system that lead to the observed patterns. For instance, if we find that
the relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the
5-year risk of lung cancer can be approximated by a sigmoid function, it
does not tell us much about the mechanisms leading from smoking to lung
cancer.

The big category that I call phenomenological models can of course be
further divided. A useful division and way of thinking is between fairly
simple models based on some underlying statistical theory and used to
explain relations between some factors and some outcome, versus more
complicated, often ``black-box'' type of models that are mainly used to
predict an outcome based on some inputs. The former area is the topic of
most ``classical'' statistical work, while the latter often goes by
names such as machine learning, data mining, or similar. While simple
models are sometimes considered explanatory and can provide clues toward
causal links between some inputs and some outputs, they still do not
provide insights regarding the mechansisms, which distinghuishes all of
these models from mechanistic ones. For more information on the
explanatory vs.~predictive approach to model uses, the papers (Shmueli
\protect\hyperlink{ref-shmueli10}{2010}) and (Breiman and others
\protect\hyperlink{ref-breiman01}{2001}) are good starting points.

<<<<<<< HEAD
\#\#\#Mechanistic Models A class of models that is complementary to the
just discussed phenomenologica models are mechanistic models, which
explicitly - albeit usually in very simplified form - try to model the
mechanisms of interaction among system components. These models are
commonly used the hard sciences and engineering. For instance the
mathematical equations describing the movement of fluids or
electromagnetic fields, or computer simulations of airplane engines, are
based on such mechanistic models. The advantage of these kinds of models
is that they potentially provide better and deeper understanding of the
system. The main disadvantage is that we already need to know (or at
least assume) a good bit about how the components interact for us to be
able to build such a model. If we have no idea what mechanisms are at
work in our system of interest, we cannot build a mechanistic model.
Because of that, areas that are currently less well understood (e.g.~the
functioning of the stock market or the working of brains) are currently
not well described by mechanistic models.

usually in very simplified form - try to model the mechanisms of
interaction among system components. These models are commonly used the

describing the movement of fluids or electromagnetic fields, or computer
simulations of airplane engines, are based on such mechanistic models.
The advantage of these kinds of models is that they potentially provide

that we already need to know (or at least assume) a good bit about how

cannot build a mechanistic model. Because of that, areas that are
currently less well understood (e.g.~the functioning of the stock market
or the working of brains) are currently not well described by
mechanistic models.
>>>>>>> master

One advantage of a mechanistic model is that once it is specified and
built, it can be investigated (either mathematically, or more likely
through computer simulations) without the need of additional data. For
instance, our ability to build decent models capturing the salient
features of hurricane dynamics allows us to forecast the storm
trajectory. An example of a simulation for a simple mechanistic model is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:sirsim}.

Both phenomenological (statistical) and mechanistic models are useful
tools with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Deciding which one to
use depends on the question and study system. In this book, we focus on
mechanistic models, which try to represent an explicit, simplified
description of the system of interest.

\#\#\#Dynamical Models While the interactions of components always have
some implicit time factor, the explicit consideration of time in models
is not always needed. Consider this example: We could build a model to
study how a change in tobacco taxes might lead to changes in healthcare
costs in a given state. Of course, time is present in this system: First
we change the taxes, and then we look at changes in costs over some time
frame. However, when studying this system, one usually doesn't need to
consider an explicitly time-dependent dynamic. Instead one looks at 2
scenarios: Taxes 1 \& Costs 1 versus Taxes 2 \& Costs 2. It is usually
not necessary to model or simulate the chain of events leading from tax
change to cost change while explicitly accounting for time.

However, often the interactions of components that make up a system
occurs over time and the temporal component needs to be included. We
often want to know how certain changes to the system
(e.g.~interventions) lead to changes in outcomes through a
\emph{dynamical/time-dependent} chain of events. This leads to dynamical
models. For infectious diseases, we most often have some underlying
dynamics that we need to take into account (e.g.~an ongoing outbreak)
and on top of which we might want to implement some interventions.
Therefore, the dynamical perspective is generally used.

We can illustrate this dynamical perspective in an abstract way by
extending the epidemiological triangle. Figure \ref{fig:dynamictriangle}
shows the components and the interactions of the triangle changing over
time.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/moving-triangle.png}
\caption{\label{fig:dynamictriangle}Dynamic Epidemiological Triangle.
Interactions between agent, host and environment change explicitly with
time - indicated by the different coloring for each component and
interaction.}
\end{figure}

A more specific example of a simple dynamical model showing changes over
time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sirsim}.

Mechanistic models are especially well suited to describe dynamical
systems and are therefore the primary choice for the study of complex
dynamical systems.

\#\#\#Types of Dynamical, Mechanistic Models When building mechanistic,
dynamical models based on a systems approach, there are two main
approaches. In one approach, the model is made up of individuals (who
are sometimes called agents) and thus these types of models are called
agent based or individual based models. The agents/individuals - which
are often but not always are humans - interact with each other. Each
agent has certain properties and undergoes certain actions. The
interactions of all the agents lead to potentially interesting and
complex dynamics.

Schelling's segregation model (see e.g.
\href{https://youtu.be/dFl3Cfw12bo}{this video} ) is a nice example of
such an individual based model. Models and approaches that consider
individuals connected through networks of contacts are a type of
individual based model that is particularly important for infectious
diseases. We will discuss such network concepts in a later chapter.

Another approach simplifies the system by not tracking every individual,
but instead only keeps track of total numbers in certain states. For
instance, for an ecological model, we might track the total numbers of
predators and prey (e.g.~wolves and sheep). The resulting model is much
simpler. If we had a population of a 100, 1000 or 10,000 wolves or
sheep, we would need to keep track of as many individuals. If we only
keep track of the total number of individuals, we only need to track how
the numbers in each \emph{compartment} (here wolves and sheep) change -
no matter how large our population. Those models, which only track total
numbers of individuals, are called \emph{compartmental models}.

While these compartmental models are obviously simplifications of the
real system, they often retain enough of the model complexity to allow
us to study the system in detail. Because of this, the majority of
models used in infectious disease epidemiology are still these types of
compartmental models. Both the DSAIDE R package and the example models
shown in this book focus on such compartmental models. The only
exception is the chapter on networks.

\#\#Systems approaches in ID Epidemiology While concepts such as the
epidemiological triangle acknowledge that interactions between
components are important and determine the behavior of a system, in
practice the standard epidemiological approach, based on classical study
designs such as cohort, case-control and the randomized trial does not
consider system interactions. Indeed, a hallmark assumption of these
study designs is that individuals are independent. E.g. the chance that
someone in a cohort study has the outcome of interest does not affect
the chance of someone else having the outcome. That works well for
non-transmissible diseases, and to some extent for
transmissible/infectious diseases (we'll use the term infectious disease
in the following, mostly meaning diseases that are also transmissible),
as long as there are no interactions (i.e.~contact that could lead to
transmission) between study subjects. Accounting for interactions
between hosts is required to understand important infectious disease
concepts such as population level immunity thresholds, critical
community size, or indirect effects of interventions. This, in turn,
leads to a systems approach that explicitly allows for interactions
between hosts.

On the research side, the importance of such interactions has long been
appreciated and is at the core of the infectious disease modeling
paradigm, where one builds and analyzes a system of interacting
components (e.g.~susceptible and infected hosts). Model based system
approaches have a long history in infectious disease epidemiology
(Anderson and May \protect\hyperlink{ref-anderson91}{1991}, @blower04).
The importance of computational methods for the study of infectious
diseases continues to increase. In this book, we approach infectious
diseases from such a systems thinking perspective, without delving too
deeply into the mathematical and computational aspects of the topic. If
you are interested in building your own models, the books (Keeling and
Rohani \protect\hyperlink{ref-keeling08}{2008}; Vynnycky and White
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vynnycky10}{2010}) are good starting points.

\section{A Basic Infectious Disease Systems
Model}\label{a-basic-infectious-disease-systems-model}

For infectious disease models, the simplest dynamical systems model
keeps track of the total number of individuals who are susceptible,
infectious and removed/recovered (the so-called SIR model). This model
is a compartmental model, i.e.~we place individuals into distinct
>>>>>>> master
compartments, according to some characteristics. We then only track the
total number of individuals in each of these compartments. In the
simplest model, the only characteristic we track is a person's infection
status according to 3 different stages/compartments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{S} - uninfected and susceptible individuals.
\item
  \textbf{I} - infected and infectious individuals.
\item
  \textbf{R} - removed (recovered and immune or dead) individuals. Those
  are individuals that do not further participate, either because they
  are now immune or because they died.
\end{itemize}

When talking about the quantities that are tracked in each compartment,
you will see both the term \emph{host(s)} and \emph{individual(s)} used
interchangeably. While we most often think of human hosts, the hosts can
be any animal (or plants infected by viruses or bacteria infected by
phages, etc.). Sometimes, a compartment might track a quantity such as
pathogen load in the environment.

In addition to specifying the \textbf{compartments} of a model, we need
to specify the \textbf{processes/mechanisms} determining the changes in
each compartment. Broadly speaking, some processes increase the number
of individuals in a given compartment/stage and processes that lead to a
reduction. Those processes are sometimes called inflows and outflows.

For our system, we specify only 2 processes/flows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A susceptible individual (S) can become infected by an infectious
  individual (I) at some rate (for which we use the parameter \emph{b}).
  This leads to the susceptible individual leaving the S compartment and
  entering the I compartment.\\
\item
  An infected individual dies or recovers and enters the removed (R)
  compartment at some rate. This is described by the parameter \emph{g}
  in our model.
\end{enumerate}

In general, the entities that change (that vary) in our system (here the
number of individuals in compartments S, I and R) are called variables
and are each represented by a compartment. In contrast, the quantities
that are usually assumed fixed for a given system are called parameters.
For the model above, those are the infection rate \emph{b} and the
recovery rate \emph{g}. This is not a fixed rule, though, and sometimes
parameters can be allowed to vary.

The SIR model is very basic, but it still has the hallmark of a complex
system. Specifically, there is an interaction between components, namely
the \textbf{I} component interacts with the \textbf{S} component, namely
infected individuals can infect susceptibles.

For compartmental models (and often other types of models), it is useful
to show a graphical representation of the compartments and processes
included in the model. For compartmental models, such a diagram/figure
is usually called a flow diagram. Such a diagram consists of a box for
each compartment, and arrows pointing in and out of boxes to describe
flows and interactions. For the simple SIR model, the flow diagram is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:basicSIR}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/basicSIRmodelfigure.png}
\caption{\label{fig:basicSIR}Flow diagram for the simple SIR model.}
\end{figure}

To study a specific ID and scientific question, one needs to use a model
that approximates the real system one is interested in reasonably well,
and one needs to choose values for the model parameters and starting
conditions such that they match the specific system one wants to study.
We'll return to that idea throughout this book.

We can implement the flow diagram as a computer model, for instance by
formulating it as the set of ordinary differential equations shown
below, and then implementing those on a computer to simulate an
outbreak. Figure \ref{fig:sirsim} shows such a simulation.

Unfortunately, there are no rules concerning the naming of variables and
parameters. Compartments (e.g.~SIR) tend to be labeled very similarly by
different researchers, while parameter labels are much more variable.
I'm trying to be consistent in this book, though I might mix it up
occasionally. For this book, I decided to stick with letters from the
English alphabet, but you can often find people use Greek letters for
parameters (e.g. \(\beta\) instead of \emph{b} for the transmission
parameter). Always check carefully what the definition and meaning of
each variable and parameter are.

Here and in other places, I am often sloppy and use the word
``infected'' even if more precisely, I mean ``infected and infectious''.
You will find such somewhat sloppy terminology throughout the
literature. Individuals who are infected but not infectious are often
given their own compartment and label, e.g.~they are called ``exposed''
or ``latent'' - see chapter \ref{idstates} for more on this. So when you
read infected throughout this book (and in most other places), assume it
means `infectious' as well, unless otherwise stated.

\subsubsection{Model Implementation}\label{myadvancedbox}

If one wants to study any model in detail, one needs to implement it
either in the form of a mathematical or a computer model (or both). For
compartmental models, the most common way of implementation is writing
the model as a set of ordinary differential equations and implementing
those in some computer language. This book shows sets of ODE equations
for most of the discussed models, but a detailed understanding of these
equations is not required to understand the different topics we discuss.
For the model described above, the equations look like this:
\[\dot S = -bSI\] \[\dot I = bSI - gI\] \[\dot R = gI\]

We are using the usual short-hand notation, where a dot over a variable
means its derivative (its change) with respect to time. In all the
models we consider, we always only consider changes with respect to time
(the dynamical aspect of the model). The left side indicates which
variable changes, and the right side indicates how it changes. Anything
with an (usually not shown) positive sign on the right side describes a
positive change, i.e.~an inflow into the specified compartment, thus
increasing the number in that compartment. Anything with a negative sign
indicates an outflow out of that compartment.

In this module, we will discuss ways to characterize individuals with
regard to their infection status, e.g.~susceptible, symptomatic
infected, revovered and immune. We will consider why some infection
states are important for public health control but less important from
an individual patient, medical perspective, and the reverse. We will
also discuss the connection between infectious disease states and
compartments in computer models.

  Ability to accurately categorize infectious diseases according to
  medical and public health characteristics
\item
  Evaluate the impact of different infection states on medical outcomes
  and disease dynamics
\item
  Understand how ``medical states'' (e.g.~symptoms) and ``public health
  states'' (e.g.~infectiousness) do not always overlap.

\item
  Understand how different infections states are represented in

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In the previous chapter, we introduced a very simple compartmental
systems model for an infectious disease (the SIR model) where
individuals were split according to 3 states related to the infectious
disease of interest: susceptible, infected (and infectious) and
recovered (and immune). Sometimes, placing individuals into one of these
3 categories provides a reasonable approximation of reality. It is easy
and thus often a good starting point. However, at some point we might
want to categorize infection states of individuals in some more detail.
For instance, for a disease like tuberculosis, a large fraction of
individuals who are infected are not infectious. Thus, combining all of
those who are infected into a single group is not realistic. We have to
allow for more distinct categories. there is potentially an unlimited
number of states we can consider. For instance for HIV, we could
categorize infected individuals into sub-groups based on their CD4 cell
count - and the number of such sub-groups is essentially infinite.
Fortunately, to get a fairly realistic picture of most diseases, we can
usually get away with introducing just some additional categories. The
following sections discuss the major categories with regard to infection
status of individuals.

\hypertarget{states-of-susceptibility}{%
\section{States of susceptibility}\label{states-of-susceptibility}}

The simplest assumption is to classify everyone as susceptible. While
this is true in some instances, e.g.~for a newly emerging disease, often
this assumption is not justified. Depending on the disease and
population, some individuals might not be susceptible, e.g.~because they
previously had the infection and have natural immunity, or they received
a vaccine or they have a genetic make-up that makes them non-susceptible
(examples are the CCR5-delta 32 mutation in HIV or the FUT2-G428A for
some norovirus strains). The easiest way to deal with individuals who
are not susceptible is to ``ignore'' them, i.e.~simply not include them
in any models for that disease. Alternatively, if the model has a
recovered and immune class, one can place all those individuals in that
category.

It gets more complicated if susceptibility is only somewhat reduced.
This is common for some vaccines, which often do not offer full
protection, but instead reduce the chance of getting infected (and if
infection occurs, often disease severity is reduced). If you wants to
account for this, you will have to introduce a new state into your
conceptual/mathematical/computer model. For instance you could have a
category \emph{S} of fully susceptible individuals, and a category
\emph{Sp} of partially susceptible. Those individuals would get infected
at a lower rate compared to fully susceptible individuals. If reduced
susceptibility can wane, e.g.~due to the wearing off of a vaccine
induced immunity, one might need to include a process in the model by
which \emph{sp} individuals transition back into the \emph{S} category.

\hypertarget{states-of-infection}{%
\section{States of Infection}\label{states-of-infection}}

Categorizing individuals beyond the simple \emph{infected and
infectious} category is often the most important addition to a model if
one wants to make things more realistic. Several important states are
commonly distinguished and described in the next few sections.

\hypertarget{latent-infection}{%
\subsection{Latent infection}\label{latent-infection}}

Many important diseases (e.g.~HIV, Tuberculosis), have a state during
which an individual is infected but does not show any symptoms. This is
usually called \emph{latent} infection. Sometimes the term
\emph{exposed} is also used. Latent, non-symptomatic infected
individuals might (HIV) or might not (TB) be infectious. It is important
to keep in mind that infectiousness and symptoms are not always
overlapping. The former is the most important driver of the ongoing
infection process and drives the observed disease dynamics on the
population level. The latter is important for surveillance and medical
interventions.

\hypertarget{symptomatic-infection}{%
\subsection{Symptomatic infection}\label{symptomatic-infection}}

From a purely medical perspective, focusing on one patient at a time,
the most important characteristic of a disease is its severity, also
called morbidity. We would like to know what kind of symptoms a disease
produces and how frequently those occur. This is the morbidity profile
of a disease. One can consider mortality the ``ultimate symptom''.
Because of its importance, mortality is often considered separate from
morbidity. Knowing morbidity and mortality of an ID are generally most
important when caring for individual patients. For interventions,
understanding what might help mitigate morbidity and mortality is of
prime interest.

Most diseases lead to a state with morbidity, i.e.~where an infected
individual shows symptoms. Those diseases that don't are usually not of
much medical and public health interest. During the symptomatic state,
individuals are generally infectious. The question how symptoms might or
might not impact infectiousness is important but not too well
understood. Qualitatively, we know that coughing and sneezing help
spread many respiratory pathogens, while the symptoms an HIV infected
individual displays during the AIDS stage are likely not increasing
infectiousness. The connection of symptoms, morbidity and mortality and
its relation to infectiousness is the main theme underlying the topic of
\emph{virulence}, which we'll cover later in the chapter on virulence
evolution.

Morbidity and mortality are also often important for public health
surveillance. It is generally difficult to capture infected individuals
that do not show symptoms, those that are symptomatic - and obviously,
those that die - are easier to count and thus get estimates for disease
prevalence and incidence.

\hypertarget{asymptomatic-infection}{%
\subsection{Asymptomatic infection}\label{asymptomatic-infection}}

After infection, for almost all diseases there is a latent period when
symptoms are not yet visible. For many diseases, the whole course of
infection is asymptomatic in at least a fraction of infected
individuals. If such asymptomatic individuals are infectious, they are a
potentially important driver of the infection dynamics. Since
asymptomatic indivuals are often not picked up by surveillance, they can
pose problems for the control of a disease.

Note that some diseases can show complicated patterns of symptoms,
e.g.~for malaria symptoms can be intermittent, with periods of no
symptoms in between.

\hypertarget{post-infection-states}{%
\section{Post-infection states}\label{post-infection-states}}

After infection is over, it is possible for an individual to enter
different states. So far, we only considered a \emph{recovered and
immune} state. in the classic SIR model, those \emph{R} individuals are
immune forever and thus do not further influence the systems dynamics.
However, some infectious diseases either do not induce immunity
(e.g.~many sexually transmitted diseases) or only lead to short-term
immunity (e.g.~norovirus or influenza). If a disease does not induce
immunity, one can conceptualize and model this by assuming that after
infection, individuals directly enter the susceptible state again
(leading to the SIS model).

If we assume that everyone has immunity only for a short period of time,
we can account for that by having infected individuals first enter the
recovered state, and then from that state move at some rate back to the
susceptible state (leading to the SIRS model).

Things can get more complicated when combined with different infection
states. For instance it might be that those individuals who had an
asymptomatic case of the disease aquire immunity that lasts less long
compared to those who were symptomatic infected. We then need to have 2
different recovered compartments, each with its own rate of returning to
the susceptible state.

A special and important post-infection state is death. From a ID
dynamics perspective, a dead person generally behaves like a recovered
and immune person, i.e.~they do not further influence the infection
dynamics (ignoring special cases such as e.g.~Ebola where transmission
after death has been observed). Of course, from a medical and public
health perspective, a recoverd and immune person is a favorable outcome
while a dead person is not.

\hypertarget{medical-versus-id-dynamics-perspectives}{%
\section{Medical versus ID dynamics
perspectives}\label{medical-versus-id-dynamics-perspectives}}

I hope that the above description of different states made it clear that
features that are important from a medical perspective (e.g.~severity of
symptoms), might or might not be important for understanding the
dynamics of the disease. To properly study the dynamics of an ID, we
need to know when someone is infectious (e.g.~before/without symptoms,
or only when symptomatic), how transmission occurs, if recovered
individuals become immune, if immunity is waning, etc. The difficult
part is that our data often comes from clinical (symptomatic) cases or
deaths. If asymptomatic individuals are infectious, or there is
underreporting, we often don't get the full picture. This is discussed
further in the surveillance chapter.

Of course, the medical and ID dynamics/epidemiological perspectives are
not an `either/or'. Instead, success in combating infectious diseases
only comes when all aspects are considered. Still, it is useful to keep
in mind that certain infection states are more important when
considering how to intervene on the individual patient level versus
intervention on a population level.

\hypertarget{models-with-more-details}{%
\section{Models with more details}\label{models-with-more-details}}

The above sections described different states that might need to be
considered and explained how models will need to be adjusted to account
for such different states. To make this more specific, figure
\ref{fig:complicatedmodel} shows a model with additional compartments.
We omit showing a mathematical representation (i.e.~a set of
differential equations) for this model. However, a very similar model,
together with the equations, can be found in the DSAIDE app referred to

While we discussed major ways to categorize individuals
(e.g.~symptomatic versus asymptomatic or infectious vs non-infectious),
one can potentially sub-divide any state into as many sub-states as one
wanted. For instance one could split infected indiduals into 10
different levels of infectiousness. The question then becomes: How
detailed and complex should our model be? What details should we include
and which ones should we omit? Tthis is an important question and
deserves a detailed answer, which I am trying to provide in the
Appendix, Chapter \ref{modelcomplexity}.

might have made differently, and why? Are there other assumptions the
authors make when building the model that are not included in their list

are currently not in the model?

Different IDs show different patterns in their dynamics. Some IDs
produce sporadic outbreaks and then seem to disappear for years. Ebola
is a prominent example. Other ID seem to be `always around' and
incidence or prevalence might change little. TB and HIV in some parts of
the world, as well as certain STD and chronic viral infections show such
patterns. Many other IDs show oscillatory behavior, i.e.~we repeated
outbreaks or increases in incidence, followed by periods of reduced
incidence. For some ID, these patterns of increase and decrease are
annual, for other ID the cycles are multi-year. Figure
\ref{fig:IDcycles} shows an example of such patterns of increase and
decrease for measles and pertussis.

>>>>>>> master

The basic SIR model considered in chapter \ref{idintro} can capture the
dynamics of a single outbreak, it can however not reprduce repeat
oscillations or endemic states. The reason for this inability of the
simple model to produce more than one outbreak is because as the ID
spreads, it depletes the pool of susceptibles. At then end of the
outbreak, there are not enough susceptible individuals left to allow for
a second outbreak or an endemic state. In ecological terms, the
infectious disease depleted its resources (i.e.~its hosts) and
subsequently dies out. This is a very general principle: We see that in
predators consuming prey, forest fires consuming trees, and pathogens
``consuming'' their susceptible hosts. If the resources are not
replenished quickly enough, the consumer of these resources will go
extinct. To sustain the continued presence of the consumer/predator,
resources need to be replenished.

For our scenario, the resource consumer is the ID, and the resources are
the susceptible hosts, usually humans. To sustain endemic states or
repeat increases in incidence, susceptible hosts need to be entering the
system. This can happen through different mechanisms. The most common
processes to add new susceptibles to a population is through the birth
of new, susceptible individuals, or through the loss of immunity, and
return to the susceptible class, of existing hosts. Migration, if
strong, can be another way susceptible hosts can be replenished.
Similarly, individuals that become newly sexually active correspond to
the birth of new susceptibles for sexually transmitted infections.

If the replenishment of new susceptibles is fast enough to balance the
depletion of resources by the ID, an ID might be able to maintain itself
in a population and lead to either oscillatory patterns or an endemic
state.

The new features of this model compared to the basic SIR model
introduced earlier are births (of susceptibles) at some rate \emph{m},
and the possibility that recovered lose their immunity and return to the
susceptible class at rate \emph{w}. Both of these processes can produce
new susceptibles and thus lead to resource replenishment. If this
process is fast enough, it can allow the ID to persist and lead to
oscillations/cycles or steady states.

The model shown in \ref{fig:birthdeathdmodel} also includes natural

death at rate \emph{n}. This is done to for several reasons. One is
simply consistency. If we make the model more detailed by taking into
account natural births, it seems reasonable to also include natural
death. Another, related reason is that without death in the model to
balance births, we would have a population which grows without bounds.
This is not a good approximation of any real scenario. When you
implement models, especially larger ones, you always want to make sure
that each component of the model produces reasonable results by itself.
In this example, in the absence of disease, we would like to have
susceptible individuals reach some steady level depending on births and
deaths. Without the inclusion of the death rates, this could not happen.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Equations for the Model with Resource
replenishment}\label{myadvancedbox}}

The ordinary differential equations corresponding to the compartmental
model shown in figure \ref{fig:birthdeathdmodel} are given by

\[\dot S = m - b I S + wR - n S \] \[\dot I = b IS - gI - n I \]
\[\dot R =  gI - wR - n R\]

\#\#Intrinisic Cycles The interaction between susceptible and infectious
hosts can lead to a dynamical pattern that can/does produce
oscillations. Specifically, the dynamics of resource consumption
(depletion of susceptible hosts), waning ID incidence due to reduced
availability of hosts, and subsequent replenishment of susceptibles can
lead to cycles. Since these cycles are not driven by anything ``from the
outside'' and arise purely due to the complex interplay between host
resources and ID, there are sometimes called intrinsic
cycles/oscillations. The timing of these cycles (the period of the
oscillations) is determined by characteristics of the ID and scenario.
For instance, the duration of the infectious period and the
transmissibility of the host influence the timing of outbreaks. In
ecology, such cycles are well studied in the context of so-called
predator-prey systems. For our infectious disease models, the ``prey''
are the susceptibles and the ``predators'' are the infected individuals.

\#\#Intrinisic Cycles and models One can sometimes compute the time
between outbreaks. For the simple compartmental SIR model, an
approximate equation for the period close to the endemic state is
\[T \approx 2 \pi \sqrt{\left( \frac{LD}{R_0 - 1} \right)}\]

Here, \emph{L} is the average lifespan of a host, \emph{D} is the
average duration of infectiousness, and \emph{R\textsubscript{0}} is the
basic reproductive number - a quantity we will discuss in chapter
\ref{R0} For more details on this equations, see e.g. (Keeling and
Rohani \protect\hyperlink{ref-keeling08}{2008}).

For more complicated models and real-world scenarios where the simple
SIR model is not a good approximation, the equation just provided does
not apply anymore. It might not even be possible to write down any
equation. One can then instead run a computer simulation of the model
and determine the length of the cycles from the time-series returned by
the computer. The main point still holds, independent of the ability to
write down an equation for the cycle length, namely that there is a
relation between intrinsic characteristics of the system, such as
duration of infectious period (\emph{D}) and transmissibility of the
disease (\emph{R\textsubscript{0}}), and the period of the oscillations.
In cases where we cannot derive a mathematical equation, we can try to
figure out the relation between cycle duration and some parameter of
interest. This can be achieved by repeatedly altering the parameter
(e.g.~the duration of the infectious period, \emph{D}), and recording
the cycle period, \emph{T}, reported by the model simulation for various
values of the parameter. By plotting a figure showing \emph{D} on the
x-axis and \emph{T} on the y-axis, we obtain a relation between these
quantities.

\#\#External Drivers of Cycles Another mechanism that can lead to
oscillations in the dynamics of ID can come from ``external'' drivers.
Of course, these processes are still part of the whole system, but not
as directly as the dynamics and interaction of the hosts. In that sense,
we consider it an external process.

Weather is one of the most important external factors. Many IDs are
influenced by the weather. For instance influenza virus survives better
when the vapor pressure is low, which in temperate regions is usually
the case in winter (Lipsitch and Viboud
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lipsitch09}{2009}, @shaman10).

Other types of seasonality are related to human activity and behavior.
For instance, many childhood diseases increase in incidence when a new
school year starts.

For some ID, weather and behavior interact. Many water-borne diseases in
the U.S. see an uptick in summer. This is due to behavior changes in the
host: More people swim in outdoor water in the summer.

Often, more than one mechanism occurs and influences the ID dynamics. As
such, it is often not possible to isolate a single factor as the main
important one. It often depends on the particular setting.

In the type of models we have looked at so far, seasonality or some
other external driver is needed to sustain oscillations. Without it, the
cycles die out, and the disease reaches a steady, endemic state. For
more complex models or models that include stochastic dynamics (discuss
in chapter \ref{stochastic}), cycles can be maintained even in the
absence of external drivers.

<<<<<<< HEAD
\#\#Steady states In addition to single outbreaks or recurrent cycles,
ID often also reach a state where the prevalence in a population is
roughly constant. This is usually referred to as an endemic state.
Examples of that are e.g.~helminth infections in many African countries
(in the absence of control efforts) or certain sexually transmitted
diseases in developed countries.

\section{Steady states}\label{steady-states}

In addition to single outbreaks or recurrent cycles, ID often also reach
a state where the prevalence in a population is roughly constant. This
is usually referred to as an endemic state. Examples of that are
e.g.~helminth infections in many African countries (in the absence of
control efforts) or certain sexually transmitted diseases in developed
countries.
>>>>>>> master

At steady state, the total number of ID cases (the prevalence) does not
change. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that there are
still constantly new cases occuring, i.e.~the incidence is not zero. It
just happens to be the case that the incidence is roughly similar to the
rate at which existing cases disappear (e.g.~through recovery or death),
such that the turnover process is in balance, leading to a a roughly
constant prevalence.

If we have a mathematical or computer model of our system, there are two
ways to determine steady states. One is mathematical, and the other is
through simulating the system. The former approach is more elegant and
powerful but only works if we have a relatively small model. It is
illustrated in the box below. Often, the model is too complicated to
obtain useful equations for the steady state values of the model
variables. Fortunately, we can always determine them numerically. We
simply start our computer simulation model with some values and run it
long enough until it has settled down (we need to make sure it does have
a steady state). We can then record the steady state values. We can do
this for different model parameter values (e.g.~changes in birth rate or
changes of rate of infection). In the end, we can plot a figure showing
how the steady state values change with some model parameter. This
approach is obviously much slower than using the mathematical equations.
However, often it is the only feasible approach.

Note that there are technically steady states that exist but won't show
up in the simulation since they are unstable. Since any unstable steady
state also rarely exists in nature (other than the disease free state,
with a population remaining in that state until a new pathogen arrives),
those steady states tend to be not that important in practice.

\#\#\#\#Steady States and Models \{\#myadvancedbox\} When an ID reaches
a steady state, a model based on ordinary differential equations, such
as the model shown above, simplifies. At steady state, there are -- by
definition -- no changes in the total number of individuals in each
compartment. Therefore the left side of the equations are zero, i.e.
\(\dot S = \dot I = \dot R =0\). This changes the differential equations
into a set of algebraic equations. For a fairly small set of equations
(usually \textless{} 5), one can obtain equations for the compartments
(\emph{S}, \emph{I}, and \emph{R} in this case) at steady state that are
a function of the model parameters. While it is often theoretically
possible to solve models with more compartments/equations, the resulting
expressions are usually so big and unwieldy to not provide much useful
insight.

The hard method of solving this set of equations is with pen and paper.
Nowadays, there is software that can do it for you. The two most
important packages for such tasks are
\href{http://www.maplesoft.com/}{Maple} and
\href{https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/}{Mathematica}. Both are
commercial products, fairly powerful and quite expensive. If you only
need a program for occasionally solving such equations, free
alternatives are available. I usually use
\href{http://maxima.sourceforge.net/}{Maxima}.
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_computer_algebra_systems}{Other
packages exist}. Note that \texttt{R} is not suitable for solving
symbolic equations. Using Maxima to solve the equations above (without
immune recovery, i.e. \emph{w=0}, to make the results simpler) gives:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/SSmaxima.png}
\caption{\label{fig:SSmaxima}Maxima code for solving the SIR model steady
state equations.}
\end{figure}

The same results are of course obtained when solving the equations by
hand. The first steady state returned by maxima is the one in the
absence of an ID, with only susceptibles around. Usually, we are
interested in the second steady state, the endemic equilibrium at which
disease prevalence is at a fixed level. We thus find the values for the
number of susceptible, infected and recovered at steady state as a
function of the model parameters.

Having the equations for the steady state allows us to gain insight into
the system behavior rapidly. For instance we can see that for an endemic
steady state to be possible (i.e.~for \emph{I} \textgreater{} 0 at
steady state), we need \(b m > n (n+ g)\). We can make intuitive sense
out of this expression: The combination of pathogen transmission
capacity (\emph{b}) and birth rate \emph{m}, which support ID
persistence, needs to be stronger than the effects of general host death
\emph{n} and host recovery \emph{g}. We will later see that this relates
to the concept of reproductive number.

\#\#Detecting cycles or other patterns It is often hard to determine if
there is a specific repeating pattern, such as oscillations/cycles for a
given ID. Consider for instance Figure \ref{fig:gonorrheapattern}
(\href{http://www.cdc.gov/STD/stats06/images/trends-img-2.gif}{Source
CDC}). One can see that Gonorrhea incidence was fairly stable between
1950-1965 and again 1995-2005, with ups and downs in between. The
changes are not rapid enough to be due to seasonal/annual drivers. If we
had more data and the same up-down pattern repeated, we could speculate
that this might be due to some intrinsic oscillatory dynamics of the
disease. In this case, the most likely explanation for the observed
patterns lies outside the disease dynamics itself. Increased detection
and treatment likely led to a decline in the 40s, changing sexual
behavior lead to an increase starting in the 60s, and strong safe-sex
campaigns, combined with the threat of HIV, resulted in a decrease
starting in the 80s. However, this is somewhat speculative. It might
well be that other factors, (e.g.~changes in surveillance intensity)
could explain the pattern. A careful analysis (which I have not done)
would be needed before one can be more confident as to what might lead
to the observed pattern.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/gonorrhea.png}
\caption{\label{fig:gonorrheapattern}Gonorrhea cases in the US.}
\end{figure}

\#\#ID Dynamics in Changing Populations The idea of resource
replenishment described above assumes in its simplest forms that in the
absence of the ID, the host population is in steady state. That is, the
number of births and deaths balance each other, and the population size,
therefore, stays constant. We then investigate ID dynamics on top of
such a constant population (which then might not be constant anymore if
the disease leads to many deaths).

One can go a step further and consider an underlying population that
changes in size due to underlying growth or decline of the population.
We can then study the dynamics of an ID on top of an already dynamically
changing population. While this is not much more complicated to do with
computer models, it is harder to understand what exactly is going on in
the system. For instance, consider an ID with high mortality in a
growing population. If we just looked at the population size, it could
be that it remains constant, due to the two processes of natural
population growth and disease induced mortality balancing each other.
We, therefore, need to study how the different processes affect ID
dynamics carefully.

\#\#Summary and Cartoon This module provided a discussion of the various
general patterns we observe in the dynamics of ID. Those are individual
outbreaks, cycles of repeated outbreaks, and steady endemic states.

observed pattern (and not one of the others). Speculate what kind of
change to the ID/system could change the observed pattern (even if that
change is not biologically realistic). * Read the article ``Dynamical
resonance can account for seasonality of influenza epidemics'' by
Dushoff et al (Dushoff et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-dushoff04}{2004}).
They suggest an interesting explanation for the seasonal variation in
influenza cases. Look at the literature to see if since that paper came
out, there has been any further progress on that question. Discuss
recent advances that might support or refute the idea suggested by

The reproductive number is a fundamental concept in infectious disease
epidemiology. It is so important, it even made its way into (at least)
one mainstream movie (``Contagion''
\protect\hyperlink{ref-contagionmovie}{2011})! It is simple in its
definition and rather useful. The hard part is to correctly estimate the
reproductive number for a given disease and scenario. We will discuss
all these aspects in the following.

The learning objectives for this chapter are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Know how the reproductive number is defined
\item
  Kow how to compute the reproductive number from data
\item
  Apply the reproductive number concept to ID control

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-2}}

We generally want to prevent infectious diseases from causing outbreaks,
stop already ongoing outbreaks, reduce the number of people getting
infected, or even bolder, try to eradicate a disease. If we were able to
make a vaccine against an infectious disease, it is useful to know what
fraction of the population should be vaccinated to prevent future
outbreaks or even eradicate the disease.

Assume you asked the ``person on the street'' the question: ``If we
wanted to prevent a potential future SARS outbreak, what fraction of the
U.S. population do we need to vaccinate to make a large-scale outbreak
impossible?'' I suspect that most people would likely say that nearly
everyone needs to be vaccinated to prevent outbreaks. A smaller number
of people might realize that we don't need to vaccinate everyone, just
enough people to sufficiently reduce the disease's transmission
potential. To reach the second answer, one needs to have thought about
how infectious diseases `work'.

If you happen to come across an ID public health specialist or ID
modeler, you might get a different answer. Namely, they might provide
you with a quantitative estimate of the fraction of people that need to
get vaccinated. They might, for instance, tell you that we would need to
vaccinate around 70\% of the population. This is, of course, the best
kind of information. How do we figure this out? That's where the
reproductive number concept comes into play.

\hypertarget{reproductive-number-definition}{%
\section{Reproductive number
definition}\label{reproductive-number-definition}}

The concept and definition of the reproductive number are rather
straightforward: The reproductive number (usually abbreviated with R),
is defined as the average number of secondary infectious cases caused by
one infectious individual (before they recover or die or are otherwise
not able to further transmit). The following figure illustrates the
concept.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/R0scheme.png}
\caption{Schematic showing the definition of the reproductive number.
Each person `produces' \emph{on average} 2 other infectious individuals.
(Of course, we would usually need to have more data than shown in this
figure to properly estimate R.)}
\end{figure}

From this definition of the reproductive number, it is clear that if the
value is greater than 1, the pathogen keeps spreading to more and more
people and we have a growing outbreak. Conversely, if R is less than 1,
the outbreak will fizzle out. Because of this characteristic, it is
important to know R for a given outbreak, which will then tell us how
stringent the interventions need to be to bring the outbreak under
control. This is more explained in the following sections.

\hypertarget{reproductive-number-details}{%
\section{Reproductive number
details}\label{reproductive-number-details}}

Let's look a bit closer at the definition for R. First, note that it
applies to population \textbf{averages}. A single person might infect
none, a few or many others. R does not capture this detail. It only
describes the average. That's why it is, for instance, possible to have
R=2.5 or other non-integer numbers. Of course, it is not possible for an
individual to infect 2.5 others, but since R describes an average, such
fractional infections are possible. This \textbf{population average}
feature of R is a strength since it makes R relatively easy to
determine. It is also a weakness since often we'd like to know the
distribution in addition to the mean/average - we'll discuss that when
we deal with ideas such as population heterogeneity, core groups, and
super-spreaders in later chapters.

Another point to note is that the definition is about the number of new
\textbf{infectious} hosts produced by one infectious host. For some
diseases, being infected and being infectious are pretty much the same.
E.g. pretty much everyone who is infected with HIV is also - to some
degree - infectious. For other diseases, that is not the case. For
instance, the majority of people who get infected with TB will never
reach a state where they are infectious. To compute R, we do not count
the average number of individuals an infectious person infects, but only
those that later go on to become infectious themselves. The same idea
applies when we talk about diseases that have multiple hosts. R is
defined as the number of infectious hosts `produced' by one infectious
host of the same type. For instance, for vector-borne diseases, R would
be the number of infectious humans `produced' by one infectious human
via the intermediary mosquito/vector stage. While conceptually still
straightforward, measuring and computing R/R\textsubscript{0} in such
multi-host situations can get tricky.

A special case of the reproductive number is at the beginning of an
outbreak when essentially everyone in the population is susceptible. In
this case, when we assume everyone is susceptible, we define a special
quantity called the \emph{basic} reproductive number, abbreviated as
R\textsubscript{0}. The quantity R\textsubscript{0} is a measurement of
the transmission potential of a disease in a particular setting. It does
by definition not change during an ongoing outbreak. The more general
definition of the reproductive number, R, does change during an
epidemic. We'll discuss that more below.

While I will be mainly using the term reproductive number, there are
alternative names for R. In general, any combination of
reproductive/reproduction and ratio/number is ok terminology. In its
early days, R was called reproductive rate. This is \emph{incorrect}
terminology and should not be used. R is \textbf{not} a rate (there are
no units of inverse time). Why does that matter? See the `R is not a
rate' box for an example. Unfortunately, old habits die slowly and you
can still see the word `rate' applied to the reproductive number in some
recent publications.

\subsubsection{Why R Is Not a Rate - Example}\label{myexamplebox}

It is important to understand that R only provides a measure of how
transmissible a pathogen is, R does \textbf{not} provide any information
about the speed at which transmission occurs. This is an important
limitation of R. Consider 2 infections with the similar reproductive
number, say HIV and SARS, which are both estimated to have a
reproductive number of around 3-4. If we let an outbreak `run its
course', we would - based on R - expect to get the same number of
infected individuals. However, the dynamics at which those infections
occur will be quite different. SARS spreads rapidly, i.e.~an infected
person infects 3-4 others within a few weeks. On the other hand, a
person infected with HIV will infect others on a timeframe of years.
These different dynamics have of course important implications on the
control approaches against diseases. Thus, while knowing R is
significant for a given disease, it doesn't tell `the full story'.

While we often say ``Infectious disease X has an R\textsubscript{0} of
Y'', this is only an approximation. R and R\textsubscript{0} also depend
on the setting. The potential for transmission for many ID is much
higher in for instance crowded locations (prisons, slums, cruise ships),
or among ``high risk groups'' (e.g.~STD in sex workers). For example in
most countries R\textsubscript{0} of HIV is below 1 in the general
population but HIV is not disappearing because it has an
R\textsubscript{0} \textgreater{} 1 in certain subgroups. The importance
of such population heterogeneity is further discused in chapter
\ref{heterogeneity} . When we talk about R, it is therefore useful to be
as specific as possible about the scenario/population/setting.

In this book, and in the literature in general, you will foten find the
use of R\textsubscript{0}, R or \emph{effective R}
(R\textsubscript{eff}) used (sloppily) in an interchangeable manner.
Usually, it is clear from the context if the symbol refers specifically
to \textsubscript{R}0 at the beginning of an outbreak in a susceptible
population, or more generally to R, the average number of secondary
infectious cases produced by one infectious individual in any
population.

Unfortunately, \emph{R} seem to be a very popular letter. In the context
of infectious disease dynamics, \emph{R} is used both to indicate the
removed compartment in an SIR model, and as abbreviation for the
reproductive number. To make things worse, it is also the name of the
programming language which I used to write the DSAIDE package which
accompanies this book. You will just have to figure out from the context
if a reference to \emph{R} means ``computer software'' or ``removed
compartment'' or ``reproductive number''. Fortunately, it should always
be clear what is meant.

\section{Outbreaks and the Change in
R}\label{outbreaks-and-the-change-in-r}}

As stated above, at the beginning of an outbreak, a specific disease in
a certain setting will have some value R\textsubscript{0}. As the
outbreak progresses, more and more hosts become infected and - for many
diseases - either die or recover and become immune to further infection.
This leads to a reduction in the reproductive number as the outbreak
progresses. For instance, at the start of the epidemic with everyone
susceptible, R\textsubscript{0}=3. Then once a third of the population
have become infected and immune, an infectious person who would have
infected three others at the beginning of an outbreak now `wastes' one
of their transmissions on an already immune person, and therefore only
infects two others. Similarly, once 2/3 of the population have become
infected and immune, R will have dropped to 1. At this point, the
outbreak does not grow further (recall, we need R\textgreater{}1 for
growth). Instead, the outbreak has reached its peak and now starts to
decline, with R continuing to go down as fewer and fewer susceptibles
remain.

\hypertarget{reproductive-number-and-outbreak-control}{%
\section{Reproductive Number and Outbreak
Control}\label{reproductive-number-and-outbreak-control}}

It is intuitively clear that if on average every infectious person
``produces'' more than one subsequent infectious person, we get a
growing epidemic. In contrast, if every infectious person ``produces''
less than one subsequent infectious person, the pathogen might transmit
a few times, but pretty soon it will disappear. Thus if we can achieve
R\textsubscript{0} \textless{} 1, e.g.~through vaccination, we can
prevent an outbreak from starting. Further, if during an outbreak we can
intervene to get R \textless{} 1, the outbreak is going to fizzle out.
Figure \ref{fig:R0intervention} illustrates this idea. If we wanted to
stop \emph{any} further transmission, we would need to get R even lower,
namely R = 0. Intervention efforts try to achieve an R as small as
possible. If we could achieve R\textsubscript{0} \textless{} 1 globally
everywhere, we could eventually eradicate a disease. The ability to do
that depends on many factors. One important one is the
R\textsubscript{0} value of any ID before we start an eradication
campaign. Intuitively, the higher R\textsubscript{0}, the harder it will
be to get it to \textless{} 1. We'll make that more explicit below.

\subsubsection{R and Outbreak Control - Example}\label{myexamplebox}}

During the large Ebola outbreak in West Africa which started in 2013, a
few Ebola patients came to the U.S., and the goal was to have R = 0,
i.e.~no ongoing transmission. That didn't quite happen, a few new
individuals got infected, but R was very close to zero. In contrast, in
West Africa, there was little hope to get R = 0 quickly. Fortunately, R
\textless{} 1 is enough. So we can `tolerate' a few further
transmissions and new cases and still get the outbreak under control
eventually. Of course, in general, we want to get R as close to 0 as
possible, especially for a disease as deadly as Ebola. But to get an
outbreak to fizzle out, we only need R \textless{} 1, not R = 0.

number a bit more quantitative. As a simple example, consider an
infectious disease with R\textsubscript{0}=2. That means on average
every infected person infects two others. If we could somehow protect a
bit more than half of the susceptibles, then a person who might have
become infected can't become infected anymore, and the \emph{effective
R} (sometimes called R\textsubscript{eff}) drops below 1. More
generally, to prevent an outbreak, a fraction p = 1-1/R\textsubscript{0}
of the population needs to be protected (e.g.~through vaccination). From
this, it follows that the higher R\textsubscript{0}, the harder it is to
control and ID. This is illustrated in figure
\ref{fig:krR0intervention}. One can see both from the figure and the
equation that a disease with say R\textsubscript{0} = 5 requires that
80\% of the population is protected such that R\textsubscript{eff} = 1.

The level of population protection at which R=1 is called critical
population (or herd) immunity level. The relation between basic
reproductive number, intervention coverage, and effective R is R=
R\textsubscript{0}(1-p). That holds true if we assume that the
intervention fully protects those to whom it is applied. If the
intervention is not perfect, we have R=R\textsubscript{0}(1-e*p), where
e is the effectiveness of the intervention (e=1 is an entirely effective
intervention).

\subsubsection{R and the SIR Model}\label{myadvancedbox}}

We can connect the concept that R\textgreater{}1 leads to growth and
R\textless{}1 leads to a decline in infectious persons with the simple
SIR model for an outbreak. The model, which we saw earlier, is given by
the following set of differential equations (Don't confuse the \emph{R}
for the recovered with the R/R\textsubscript{0} from the reproductive
number. Unfortunately it is customary to use the same letter for both.):

\[ 
\begin{aligned}
\dot S &= - b SI \\
\dot I &= b S I - g I \\
\dot R &= g I
\end{aligned}
\] For this model, what needs to be true to get an increase in the
number of infectious hosts? The influx of new infectious hosts, bSI,
needs to be larger than the outflow, gI. This condition, bSI
\textgreater{} gI, can be rewritten as 1 \textless{} (bS)/g. We then
define the quantity on the right side of this condition as the
reproductive number, R = (bS)/g. At the beginning of an outbreak, where
everyone is assumed to be susceptible (written as S=
S\textsubscript{0}), we have the special case of the basic reproductive
number, R\textsubscript{0} = (bS\textsubscript{0})/g. Note that the rate
of recovery, g, is related to the average duration of infection, D as
D=1/g. Therefore, one can also write R = DbS, with the special case
R\textsubscript{0} for S=S\textsubscript{0}, i.e.~at the beginning of an
outbreak.

Knowing the reproductive number for a particular pathogen and scenario
is important to allow for adequate intervention planning. There are
multiple ways to estimate R from data. We'll briefly discuss them now.

\subsection{Determine R at the Beginning of an
Outbreak}\label{determine-r-at-the-beginning-of-an-outbreak}
>>>>>>> master

Very early in an outbreak, there will only be a few cases, and they
occur seemingly randomly/stochastically. If the outbreak continues
growing after a while, the case numbers will increase exponentially. The
exponential growth rate, r, can be estimated from the data, essentially
by fitting a straight line to the logarithmic values of the case report
data. To go from the growth rate to R, we need some further information.
Namely, we need to know the serial interval. The serial interval, T, is
the time between onset of infection in one host to the onset of
infection in a secondary host. Sometimes T can be approximated by the
duration of the infectious period, D.

Once we know r and T, we can compute R. There are different equations
relating r and T to R, they depend on specific assumptions one makes
about the disease. One relation between r, T, and R is given by R = 1 +
rT, and another one is given by R = e\textsuperscript{rT} . For
assumptions underlying these equations and further details, see e.g.
(Wallinga and Lipsitch \protect\hyperlink{ref-wallinga07}{2007}).

Over}\label{determine-r-once-the-outbreak-is-over}
>>>>>>> master

A larger R leads to a larger outbreak (ignoring things like
interventions, behavior change, etc.). The reason to determine R is so
we can use it to predict the expected size of an (uncontrolled) outbreak
- and more importantly, we can learn how strong our intervention efforts
need to be. But we can also flip things around. Once an (uncontrolled)
outbreak has occurred, knowing the outbreak size can allow us to
estimate R. It is often possible to determine outbreak sizes after an
outbreak has occurred, e.g.~through serosurveys which show antibodies
against the disease and therefore indicate who got infected. We don't
need any `timing' information, just the fraction infected at the end.
Essentially, we need to know the number of people that got infected, and
the number of people who were at risk (i.e.~the susceptibles) at the
beginning of the outbreak. Once we know these pieces of the puzzle, we
can estimate R.

More specifically, assume we know the final size of the outbreak,
i.e.~total fraction of those becoming infected, I\textsubscript{f} =
I\textsubscript{tot}/N, where N is the population at risk and
I\textsubscript{tot} is the total number of infected. We then also know
the fraction of susceptibles that are left at the end of an outbreak,
S\textsubscript{f}=1-I\textsubscript{f}. To find R/R\textsubscript{0},
we can use the equation
R=\emph{ln}(S\textsubscript{f})/(S\textsubscript{f} - 1) (here,
\emph{ln} is the natural logarithm). The figure below shows the relation
between the fraction infected and R\textsubscript{0} graphically.

\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{fig:outbreaksize}The relation between R\textsubscript{0} and
outbreak Size. If we have information about the size of an outbreak (in
the absence of control measures), we can use it to estimate
R\textsubscript{0}. Source: Keeling and Rohani 2008 (Keeling and Rohani
\protect\hyperlink{ref-keeling08}{2008}).}
\end{figure}

For the above equation to be true, we assume that initially everyone is
susceptible and that the population is well mixed. More refined
estimates for R, with more complicated equations, are available (Ma and
Earn \protect\hyperlink{ref-ma06}{2006}).

state}\label{determining-r-at-the-endemicsteady-state}
>>>>>>> master

For an ID that is at an endemic/steady state, we have another way of
determining R\textsubscript{0}. At the endemic equilibrium, the
reproductive number is R\textsubscript{eq} = 1. If it weren't, the ID
would either grow or decline, and it wouldn't be the endemic state. At
this endemic state, a fraction of the population is still susceptible,
S\textsubscript{eq}. By definition, at the beginning of an ID with
transmissibility R\textsubscript{0}, everyone is susceptible
(S\textsubscript{0}=1, expressed as a fraction). If we know
S\textsubscript{eq}, we can then compute R\textsubscript{0} as given by
R\textsubscript{0} = R\textsubscript{eq}
S\textsubscript{0}/S\textsubscript{eq} = 1/ S\textsubscript{eq}. As an
example, if at an endemic state (with R\textsubscript{eq}=1), 50\% of
the population is susceptible, then at the beginning, when 100\% of the
population was susceptible, we have R\textsubscript{0}=2. Conversely, if
we know R\textsubscript{0}, we can predict the number of susceptibles at
the endemic state, S\textsubscript{eq}=1/R\textsubscript{0}.

\subsection{Determining R Through Age of
Infection}\label{determining-r-through-age-of-infection}
>>>>>>> master

For those ID for which an infection induces life-long immunity,
i.e.~where a host can only be infected once, the age of infection is an
important concept. Intuitively, the more infectious a disease is, the
more likely it is that a host gets an ID at an early age. For an ID that
induces immunity, one can collect serological data (i.e.~antibody
measurements) to determine the fraction of individuals of a given age
who have antibodies, which means they have been previously infected
(assuming for the moment that no vaccine is available). One can define
the median age of infection as the age at which 50\% of the population
has been infected.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/R0age.png}
\caption{\label{fig:R0age}Fraction seropositive (previously infected) as
function of age for measles. Source (Keeling and Rohani
\protect\hyperlink{ref-keeling08}{2008}).}
\end{figure}

For a simple model with certain assumptions (Keeling and Rohani
\protect\hyperlink{ref-keeling08}{2008}), one can find an approximating
equation connecting the median age of infection and the basic
reproductive number with the equation \(A \approx \frac {L}{R_0 - 1}\)
or rewritten \(R_0 \approx \frac{L}{A} + 1\). In this equation, \emph{L}
is the average life expectancy of a host and \emph{A} is the median age
of infection. This shows what we expect intuitively: Higher
R\textsubscript{0}, i.e.~more infectious ID, leads to an earlier age of
infection.

Instead of just using data for the initial exponential growth phase,
determining \emph{r} and computing R\textsubscript{0} as specified
above, we can fit some or all outbreak data to an SIR type model. We use
the data to estimate the parameters of the model. For instance, for the
simple SIR model, we would estimate the transmission rate, b, and
recovery rate, g. We can then use the equation for R\textsubscript{0}
for a given model to compute its value. For the simple SIR model, that
would be R\textsubscript{0} = bS\textsubscript{0}/g.

\hypertarget{myadvancedbox}{%
\subsubsection{Computing R for a Given Model}\label{myadvancedbox}}

Once a mathematical model for a given ID and setting has been specified,
it is often useful to compute R\textsubscript{0} for the model. Above,
we looked at one way to get R\textsubscript{0} for the basic SIR model,
i.e.~we determined that bS/g needs to be greater than 1 and that turned
out to be R\textsubscript{0}. However, it is often better to derive
R\textsubscript{0} for a given model by starting with the basic
definition: R\textsubscript{0} is the average number of secondary
infections caused by one infected individual, assuming the population is
fully susceptible. We can then reason as follows: An individual infected
person infects new susceptibles at a rate b S\textsubscript{0}, for a
duration of 1/g. Therefore the total number of newly infected
individuals is bS\textsubscript{0}/g. Let's apply the same reasoning to
a few variations of the SIR model. Consider the following SIR model with
an additional, disease-induced mortality at rate \emph{m}.

\[ 
\begin{aligned}
\dot S &= -b SI \\
\dot I &= b S I - g I - m I\\
\dot R &= g I
\end{aligned}
\]

An individual infected again infects at rate b\emph{S. The average
duration for which an individual is infectious is now 1/(g + m),
i.e.~the sum of all the outflows out of the \emph{I} compartment. That's
a general rule: The average duration of stay in a given compartment is
the inverse of the sum of all the outflows. Therefore, for this model,
we now get R\textsubscript{0} = b}S\textsubscript{0}/(g+m). Computing R
for larger models can get complicated. There are specific methods one
can use for more complex models. See for instance (Diekmann,
Heesterbeek, and Roberts \protect\hyperlink{ref-diekmann10}{2010}) for
further information on this.

\hypertarget{r-and-model-parameterization}{%
\section{R and model
parameterization}\label{r-and-model-parameterization}}

Knowing R is not only essential for public health intervention planning,
but it is also an important component of building and analysis of
infectious disease models. Most models have a parameter for the
transmission rate, such as \emph{b} in the models above. To allow
simulation of a model, all parameters need to get assigned specific
values - chosen to correspond to the disease and scenario under study.
Direct estimates of the transmission rate for a model are usually hard
to find. Instead, we often determine R/R\textsubscript{0} for a given
ID/setting and then use it to compute \emph{b} using equations like
those shown above.

\section{Summary and Cartoon}\label{summary-and-cartoon-3}
>>>>>>> master

The reproductive number is a crucial concept in infectious disease
epidemiology. It has a relatively straightforward definition. However,
estimating R for a specific disease and scenario is not always easy.

Under the assumption that everyone is susceptible, the reproductive
number gets the special name \emph{basic reproductive number} and is a
denoted by R\textsubscript{0}. Knowing R/R\textsubscript{0} helps in
planning the scale of interventions.

R only measures one -- important -- component of a disease, namely its
transmission potential/transmissibility. For a full understanding of a
given disease, we need to know other characteristics such as speed of
transmission, the severity of disease including mortality, routes of
transmission, and other disease specific details.

The simplicity of R is both its strength and its weakness. It gives a
quick, quantitative assessment of the transmission potential (and
therefore outbreak size and needed control measures) of a disease.
However, R is a population level average and ignores heterogeneities of
host, agent, and environment. Therefore any R estimates are only
approximate.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-3}}

The way in which an infectious disease transmits is important to
understand its transmission dynamics and for planning interventions. An
infectious disease can be transmitted directly or indirectly. Among
indirect ways of transmission, there are again different important
categories, such as environmental or vector-borne transmission. Often,
things are not that clear-cut: Some diseases might transmit by more than
one route, and the definition of direct and indirect is not as clear-cut
as it might sound. The following paragraphs briefly discuss the main
different transmission modes, which will then be discussed in more
detail in the following chapters.

\hypertarget{direct-transmission}{%
\section{Direct Transmission}\label{direct-transmission}}

The most straightforward way of transmission is direct transmission from
infected to uninfected host. The clearest example of direct transmission
are sexually transmitted diseases. It is generally the case that direct
physical contact between infected and uninfected host is required for
transmission. Exceptions exist, such as transmission of HIV through
infected needle sharing, which could even be considered a type of
vector-borne transmission, but non-direct modes of transmission are not
common.

Respiratory diseases are often also considered to transmit directly if
close proximity between infected and uninfected host is needed for
successful transmission. Examples are measles and influenza. It gets a
bit tricky though since many respiratory pathogens can also transmit by
first being deposited in the environment (e.g., inside tiny water
particles floating in the air for a long time, or on a bathroom faucet).
Then if an uninfected person comes into contact with the contaminated
environment, they can get infected. The importance of direct versus
indirect/environmental transmission for many respiratory pathogens is
still not fully understood, and can likely differ between different
settings.

Another path of direct transmission is from mother to baby before or
during birth. This is often called \emph{vertical transmission}, while
all other forms discussed above and below are called \emph{horizontal
transmission}. HIV is an example of a pathogen that can transmit via
both routes.

\hypertarget{environmental-transmission}{%
\section{Environmental Transmission}\label{environmental-transmission}}

As just mentioned, respiratory infections might spread through an
environmental stage, where the environment is small water particles in
the air or on solid surfaces. Infected surfaces (in the context of ID
transmission often called fomites) are major routes of transmission for
several important pathogens, for instance, Staph or pathogens that
transmit through the fecal-oral route, e.g., norovirus. Water is the
main transmission environment for another important fecal-orally
transmitted disease, Cholera. The chapter on environmental transmission
will discuss this route in more detail.

\#\#Vector-borne Transmission Diseases that transmit through a vector
stage, such as Malaria, Dengue, Zika, and others, are an important
category. The most common and important vector are mosquitos, but other
vectors are also important (e.g., kissing bugs for Trypanosoma, which
causes Chagas disease). The definition of what makes an ID a vector
borne ID is tricky. See the HIV-needle example above, or consider Zika,
which can transmit by multiple routes. For some diseases, it is not
clear if one should consider them vector-borne or not. For instance,
\emph{Toxoplasma gondii} spends part of its life-cycle in cats, and the
other part can be in another host, most commonly mice or birds. If the
latter type of host should be considered a vector or not is largely a
matter of definition. Often, it is called an intermediate host, and
\emph{T gondii} and diseases with similar life-cycles (e.g.,
Schistosomiasis) are considered \emph{multi-host diseases}, with the
term vector-borne mainly used when the intermediate (non-human) host is
an insect. As we will see, from the perspective of describing such
diseases with models, the labeling does not make much of a difference.

\#\#Introduction The direct transmission of a pathogen means it goes
straight from an infected host to a new uninfected host. Sounds simple
enough, but as we'll discuss here \emph{straight from host to host} is
in fact not that straightforward, and many pathogens have both direct
and indirect transmission components. We'll discuss the most important
direct transmission types and what hosts fall under that umbrella.

\#\#Contact transmission The most straightforward way of transmission is
through direct contact between infected and uninfected hosts. A prime
class of pathogens that follow this route are sexually transmitted
infections (STI). For STIs, the pathogen goes directly from one host to
the other. Another pathogen for which direct contact is an important
(but not the only) route of transmission is Ebola.

A particular group of contact transmission is vertical transmission
between mother and child. This type of transmission is important for
diseases such as HIV or Ebola. To describe vertical transmission, one
needs to account for at least two different types of hosts, namely
mothers and children. We will consider different types of hosts and how
they can be represented in models in chapter \ref{heterogeneity}.

\#\#Airborne transmission Some pathogens are \emph{essentially direct}
with only a very short time spent outside the host. Many respiratory
infections fall in this category. Those pathogens are often expelled as
small air drops by the host (through breathing, sneezing or coughing)
and then are quickly inhaled by an uninfected host, thus potentially
causing a new infection. Similarly, a pathogen might for a brief time be
deposited on a surface (e.g., a bathroom faucet). Such a potentially
infected surface is often called a fomite. If the pathogen is picked up
fairly quickly by an uninfected host and thus completes the transmission
process, it is sometimes also reasonable to consider this an essentially
direct transmission process.

Some pathogens are \emph{essentially direct} with only a very short time

category. Those pathogens are often expelled as small air drops by the

sometimes also reasonable to consider this an essentially direct
transmission process.
>>>>>>> master

The decision to consider airborne or surface mediated transmission
direct or indirect transmission is very much dependent on the
perspective and focus of the question one wants to address. For some
questions and situations, assuming this route of transmission to be
essentially direct is reasonable. For instance, for a large-scale
simulation of a flu pandemic, it is usually a reasonable assumption to
consider transmission directly between infected and uninfected hosts,
without explicitly considering an environmental stage. In contrast, if
one wants to study the transmission process in detail, it might be
necessary to consider the short time the pathogen explicitly spends in
the environment and thus using the perspective discussed in the
\emph{Environmental Transmission} chapter.

\#\#Ways in which direct transmission scales For direct transmission,
there are important ways in which transmission can scale with population
size or population density. One often distinguishes between
\emph{density-dependent} and \emph{frequency-dependent} transmission.
Unfortunately, the terminology is not very consistent. Other terms are
used and sometimes misused. See, e.g. (McCallum, Barlow, and Hone
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mccallum01}{2001}, @begon02) for a discussion of
this.

The main differences between these two types of transmission have to do
with the scaling of transmission intensity (often measured by the force
of infection) as population size changes. This is a feature of the
number of contacts that a susceptible has with an infected person. For
some types of ID, e.g., STI, the number of contacts (i.e., sexual
encounters) is likely not too dependent on the population density or
size. For instance, the average person living in a town of 100,000
people likely has pretty much the same number of sexual contacts
compared to the person living in a town of 1 million. One could argue
that more opportunities might lead to more sexual contacts, but it's
unlikely to change by much. This type of invariance of transmission is
labeled (using the terminology of (McCallum, Barlow, and Hone
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mccallum01}{2001},@begon02))
\emph{frequency-dependent}.

In contrast, for some ID, more individuals (given a constant area) leads
to more contacts and more transmission. This might apply to ID such as
influenza or norovirus. A scenario where an increase in population
size/density leads to a (linear) increase in transmission is usually
referred to as \emph{density-dependent} transmission. However, even for
ID that do show some signs of density dependence, the number of social
contacts often dominates. For instance, a person in a city that is 10
times the size of a smaller city likely won't have 10 times as many
contacts.

\hypertarget{myadvancedbox}{%
\subsection{Modeling types of direct transmission}\label{myadvancedbox}}

Assuming the simple SIR model, we have the set of equations \[ 
\begin{aligned}
\dot S &= - \lambda S \\
\dot I &= \lambda S  - \gamma I \\
\dot R &= \gamma I.
\end{aligned}
\] The \emph{force of infection}, \(\lambda\) - is equal to \emph{bI}.
The force of infection can be rewritten in a different form, namely
\(\lambda= cpv\), where \emph{c} is the rate of contacts between hosts,
\emph{p} is the probability that a contact is with an infected host and
\emph{v} is the probability that transmission occurs during contact. As
an example, for HIV, \emph{c} would measure the frequency of sexual
encounters, \emph{p} would quantify the fraction of those encounters
that happen with an HIV+ individual, and \emph{p} quantifies the
probability that having sex with an HIV+ individual leads to infection.

Now, depending on the specific assumptions we make for the different
parameters, we can end up with different types of transmission. We often
assume that the probability that a contact is with an infected host is
equal to the prevalence of the ID in the population, i.e., p = I/N. This
is the so-called well-mixed population assumption and holds for both
frequency- and density-dependent SIR type models. If we wanted to relax
this assumption, we would need to switch to for instance network-based
models or build more complicated compartmental models.

For density-dependent transmission, we assume that the rate of contacts
is proportional to the density of hosts, i.e., c = kN/A, where N is the
population size and A the area, and k is some constant of
proportionality. As stated above, this might be a good approximation for
some ID and scenarios, e.g., influenza.

For frequency-dependent transmission, we assume that the rate of
contacts is fixed and independent of the density of hosts, i.e., c = f.
This might be a good approximation, e.g., sexually transmitted diseases,
where the number/density of individuals in the vicinity of an individual
does not (or only in a small way) influence the rate at which a person
has sexual contacts. We therefore end up with \(\lambda_d= kv I/A\) and
\(\lambda_f= fv I/N\) for density- and frequency- dependent
transmission. The terms \emph{kv} and \emph{fv} are often combined into
a new parameter, \emph{b\textsubscript{d}} and
\emph{b\textsubscript{f}}. If population size and area are fixed, the
transmission types lead to the same results, as long as parameter values
are chosen accordingly. If population size changes (not uncommon) or
area changes (less common), one needs to be more careful with the choice
of transmission term.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-4}}

While the distinction between direct and indirect transmission is not
clear-cut, we usually consider an ID to have an indirect mode of
transmission if the time spent outside the main host is \emph{important}
for the whole transmission cycle. The two main types of stages where a
pathogen resides outside the main host are the abiotic environment or
another host species. In the case of the former, we consider it to be
environmental transmission, in the case of the latter, it is
vector-borne. Of course, some IDs are even more complicated and have
both vector and environmental stages. This chapter focuses on
environmental transmission.

\hypertarget{environmental-transmission-basics}{%
\section{Environmental transmission
basics}\label{environmental-transmission-basics}}

Some diseases are shed by hosts into the environment, where they can
survive for a potentially extended time before re-infecting a new host.
Cholera is an excellent example of an ID that has water sources as the
environmental stage. Similarly, avian influenza is thought to survive in
cold lake water for an extended time. The important consequence of
environmental transmission is that it potentially allows new infections
to occur over long distances in time and space. For instance, an
infected person might shed Cholera into the water somewhere upstream,
and a susceptible person ingests the Cholera bacteria somewhere miles
downstream and days or weeks later. This is fundamentally different to
direct transmission, which requires close contact.

\hypertarget{environmental-transmission-and-external-drivers}{%
\section{Environmental transmission and external
drivers}\label{environmental-transmission-and-external-drivers}}

Because environmental transmission involves the survival of pathogen for
a potentially extended time in the environment, such IDs are often more
strongly influenced by external drivers compared to IDs that are
directly transmitted. The weather often has a strong impact, as do
behavior changes. E.g., humans living in temperate zones are more likely
to swim in lakes when it's warm. Therefore water-borne diseases often
have the highest incidence in warm months.

Such external drivers can be included in models by allowing certain
parameters to vary over time. For instance the transmission rate or the
rate at which environmental pathogen decays could be made dependent on
the time of the year.

\hypertarget{environmental-transmission-and-interventions}{%
\section{Environmental transmission and
interventions}\label{environmental-transmission-and-interventions}}

The environmental stage is a potentially great target for control
mechanisms. Disinfecting surfaces with chemicals such as bleach is
common practice in hospitals and other places where contamination might
be common and needs to be minimized. Similarly, attempts have been made
to disinfect the air with for instance UV radiation. Unfortunately, such
radiation can be harmful to humans, and thus this approach only works
within a system that moves and circulates air (e.g., an air-conditioning
system with a stage at which the circulated air is irradiated). All
modern water treatment plants have systems that remove pathogens, in
conjunction with good sanitation practices, have reduced the incidence
of diseases like Cholera. However, in developing countries, Cholera and
other water borne disease are still a major public health concern. Even
with proper sanitation, other pathogens like norovirus are hard to
control and still often cause local outbreaks. One reason for that is
that these viruses are hard to kill and many regular cleaning agents do
not work. Maybe the most important and famous environmental control
strategy is the tried and true method of hand washing. Our hands can be
considered a potentially infected environment (a fomite). By washing
them, the transmission of pathogens to others is minimized. The fact
that hand-washing is a great infection control strategy has been known
for centuries. Unfortunately, compliance is often still low, leading to
many needless infections, even in settings like hospitals, where one
should expect the staff to know the importance of adhering to the
hand-washing routine.

\hypertarget{myadvancedbox}{%
\subsubsection{Modeling environmental
transmission}\label{myadvancedbox}}

Most often, during the environmental stage, we assume that the pathogen
does not `do' anything. This is in contrast to vector-borne transmission
where the pathogen might, for instance, undergo replication in the
vector. Thus, we assume that infected hosts shed pathogen into the
environment, where it decays. If a susceptible person comes into contact
with the pathogen in the environment, an infection can occur. The
simplest SIR type model that can capture this process is given by \[ 
\begin{aligned}
\dot S &= - b E S \\
\dot I &= b E S  - \gamma I \\
\dot R &= \gamma I \\
\dot E &= p I - cE
\end{aligned}
\] Infected persons release pathogen into the environment at rate
\emph{p}. The pathogen decays at rate \emph{c}. A susceptible host can
get infected by contact with a contaminated environment at rate
\emph{b}.

transmission, one that has a vector stage.

The learning objectives for this chapter are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Know about important IDs that are vector-borne
\item
  Understand the implications of vector-borne transmission on ID
  dynamics
\item

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{introduction-5}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-5}}

Vector-borne IDs are those that go through - at least - two different
hosts to complete a full replication and transmission cycle. Hosts of
one type infect hosts of the other, and there is no direct transmission
between hosts of the same type.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/vectorborne-schematic.png}
\caption{Schematic of a vector-borne ID}
\end{figure}

Not surprisingly, the IDs which receive the most study are those where
one of the hosts are humans. The other host (i.e., the vector) can be
any other animal, such as dogs, rodents, snails, insects, etc. At times,
growth and replication of the pathogen occur mainly in one host, with
the other just serving as a vessel to get between hosts. Most often, the
pathogen completes significant parts of its growth and replication cycle
in both (or all, if there are more than 2) hosts.

\hypertarget{vector-borne-transmission-and-id-patterns}{%
\section{Vector-borne transmission and ID
patterns}\label{vector-borne-transmission-and-id-patterns}}

Understanding what mechanisms lead to potentially observed patterns in
incidence and prevalence for vector-borne diseases is difficult, due to
the presence of more than one host. In a previous chapter, we discussed
cycles that could be caused by the intrinsic transmission dynamics or
influenced by external drivers (e.g., seasonal changes in weather). This
general concept still holds, but there are now two species (e.g., humans
and mosquitos), both have distinct and intrinsic dynamics and responding
differently to external factors. This obviously adds a lot of complexity
to the model. Nevertheless, patterns in ID dynamics are often observed
for vector-borne diseases and are at least partially understood. For
instance, the reproductive cycle of mosquitos strongly depends on the
weather, and specifically the availability or lack of water. As such, in
regions that have strong differences in rainfall between seasons, one
often observes annual cycles based on annual weather patterns.

\hypertarget{vector-borne-transmission-and-interventions}{%
\section{Vector-borne transmission and
interventions}\label{vector-borne-transmission-and-interventions}}

With vector-borne ID, there is a unique opportunity for interventions
that do not exist for directly transmitted diseases. Namely, we can try
to control the ID at the vector stage. That often means trying to kill
as many vectors as possible. DDT in the past and more recently
pesticide-coated bed nets have been proven to work very effectively.
Unfortunately, these interventions need to be sustained. Otherwise,
mosquito numbers (or other vectors with a short lifespan) quickly bounce
back. Also, while we mostly think of mosquitos and other insects as a
nuisance or worse, they do perform important roles in the ecosystem, and
it is unclear what the consequences would be of potentially killing all
Anopheles mosquitos (they transmit a lot of important IDs). Some recent
approaches try to make mosquitos resistant to ID. If one could introduce
those and have them out-compete the mosquitos that are susceptible to
the ID, one might - in theory - get rid of relevant IDs without
affecting the ecosystem in unpredictable ways.

A major problem with all control strategies targeting vectors is that
not only do pathogens evolve quickly, but most vectors have fairly short
life spans and large population numbers, which means rapid evolution.
That could result in wide spread resistance making any control measures
ineffective within a short time. Indeed, that was observed for DDT,
where mosquitos resistant to the chemical started to appear before its
widespread use was discontinued.

\hypertarget{myadvancedbox}{%
\subsubsection{Modeling vector-borne transmission}\label{myadvancedbox}}

The easiest way to model a vector-borne disease is to simply ignore the
vector and assume that the transmission term of the equation (e.g., a
term like \emph{bSI}) represents -- in a very simplified form -- all the
complicated processes involved in transmission, including the vector
stage. That makes the model simple, but of course, doesn't capture the
vector-borne aspects of the dynamics. If we are interested in the
dynamics of the disease in all hosts, we do need to include the vector
components in a model. To add vectors in a model, one could, for
instance, build 2 SIR-type models, with one set of equations for the
(human) host and one for the vector, and then couple the compartments by
including transmission from humans to vectors and vectors to humans.
Equations for such a model might look as follows: \[
\begin{aligned}
\dot S_h &= - \beta_1 S_h I_v \\
\dot I_h &= \beta_1S_h I_v - \gamma_h I_h \\
\dot R_h &= \gamma_h I_h \\
\dot S_v &= - \beta_2 S_v I_h \\
\dot I_v &= \beta_2 S_v I_h - \gamma_v I_v \\
\dot R_v &= \gamma_v I_v
\end{aligned}
\] Here, the index \emph{h} indicates humans and \emph{v} indicates
vectors. The important vector-borne aspect of such a model is that
transmission only occurs from hosts to vector and vector to host, not
between hosts or vectors. In general, the above model needs to be
modified to more accurately describe vector-borne ID dynamics. For
instance, many vectors have a fairly short natural lifespan, and as such
their births and deaths need to be included in the model, even if the
timescale in which we investigate the model is short enough to allow us
to ignore births and deaths for (human) hosts. It is common to include
more details in the human part of the model (e.g., asymptomatic stage
and others as discussed previously) and less detail for the vector part.
The specific details that should be included are driven by the question
one wants to study.

Vector-borne transmission adds complexity to an ID, but also allows for
a wider range of control measures (such as vector killing).

\section{Overview and Learning
Objectives}\label{overview-and-learning-objectives-8}}

This chapter provides a closer look at different types of control
against infectious diseases and their potential outcomes.

The learning objectives for this chapter are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Know the major types of ID control strategies
\item
  Evaluate the use of different ID control strategies
\item
  Understand how different pathogens require different types of control
\end{itemize}

\#\#Introduction Generally, the reason why we study IDs and their
dynamics is to eventually \emph{do something}. We want to implement
control and intervention strategies to minimize disease burden. That
could be trying to contain an ongoing outbreak, reduce the incidence of
an endemic disease, or try to eradicate a disease. Depending on modes of
transmission, infectiousness profiles and other ID characteristics, the
types of interventions that are available and potentially useful will
vary. Therefore, the better we understand and ID, the better we can
likely implement control.

\#\#Goals of ID Control When trying to control an ID, we often have more
than one goal in mind. The following are a list of (overlapping) public
health goals that we often try to achieve with ID control:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reduce morbidity
\item
  Reduce mortality
\item
  Reduce transmission
\item
  Reduce incidence/prevalence
\item
  Reduce economic impact
\item
  Minimize ethical or moral dilemmas
\item
  Protect the individual
\item
  Protect the population
\end{itemize}

Most of these goals are overlapping. E.g., reducing transmission likely
reduces overall morbidity and mortality. Sometimes, goals can be
conflicting. For instance, if we have limited resources, should we
target those that are most likely to transmit but not suffer much from
the disease (e.g., children) or target those that are most likely to
experience morbidity/mortality but are not that necessary for
transmission (e.g., elderly)? Similarly, at what level is it acceptable
to force people to (not) do something (e.g., forced vaccination or
quarantine) that might not help - and maybe even slightly hurt - the
individual, but will be beneficial to society? Answers to those
questions are usually beyond the scope of just ID Epidemiology. What we
can contribute to the wider discussion is an assessment of the impact of
various control strategies. That information can then be combined with
other considerations to make decisions.

\#\#Types of Infectious Disease Control The types of control and
intervention strategies that exist for a given ID vary. Some depend on
the route of transmission. Others depend on our skills and ability,
e.g., our ability to produce a vaccine. The following sections describe
the major types of ID control.

\#\#\#Vaccination Vaccines are arguably the most cost effective public
health intervention we have. An ideal vaccine is one that has only to be
given once to induce lifelong protection against the ID. It should also
be safe, with little to no side effects. Other characteristics of a good
vaccine are ease of administration, low price and easy to transport and
store.

The only IDs we have been able to eradicate so far (smallpox and
rinderpest) are those against which we have good vaccines.
Unfortunately, a good vaccine alone does not mean eradication is likely.
Measles is a good example. We have a good vaccine, but the pathogen is
so highly transmissible that coverage would need to be at levels beyond
those currently achievable.

\#\#\#Pharmaceutical Interventions (Drugs) Drugs, most notably
antibiotics, are another very effective means of combating ID. While
vaccines try to prevent infection, drugs usually try to prevent symptoms
(morbidity and mortality) in already infected individuals. Reduction in
symptoms might or might not impact transmission dynamics. A good example
where treatment reduces infectiousness and transmission is ART treatment
for HIV infected individuals.

While not commonly used, drugs can also be given to susceptibles as
prophylaxis to reduce the risk of infection. As such, one can think of
drugs as short-term vaccines though the mechanism of protection is very
different. Again, HIV is a case in point, where pre-exposure prophylaxis
with ART has recently been shown to be somewhat effective in reducing
the risk of infection.

For some IDs, such as, helminth infections, mass drug treatment is also
being used to try and reduce ID prevalence enough to interrupt
transmission and potentially eliminate the ID.

\#\#\#Non-pharmaceutical Interventions These are the oldest types of
interventions and are often quite effective. Quarantining of either
infected or susceptibles prevents further transmission. Quarantine alone
does not help those that are already infected. Though if quarantine
occurs in a medical setting, targeted help for the sick might reduce
their morbidity and mortality. A prominent recent example for the use of
quarantine was during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. No drugs
or vaccines were available, and quarantine was the main control
strategy.

These days, strict quarantine can be hard to enforce, especially for
diseases that are not as severe as Ebola. A broader class of
intervention strategies, of which quarantine is a strong form, often
goes by the name of \emph{social distancing interventions}. E.g.,
closing a school to stop an ongoing flu or measles outbreak would
usually not be labeled as quarantine, but would be considered
\emph{social distancing}. In general, social distancing interventions
try to reduce mixing of infected and susceptible people, usually without
going as far as fully isolating/quarantining individuals. This makes the
intervention both less effective and less restrictive. Finding the right
balance between restricting individual freedoms and protecting society
can be difficult.

Another non-pharmaceutical intervention that has a profound long-term
effect is sanitation. By ensuring individuals have access to clean
water, and waste is properly disposed of, the incidence of many ID
dramatically drops. In fact, better living conditions resulted in
reduced incidence for almost all IDs, in Europe and North America even
before the introduction of antibiotics. These are commonly called
diseases of poverty.

While usually not considered ID interventions, a general improvement in
health (e.g., better nutrition), living conditions (e.g., better
housing) and health literacy (better education) are known to be very
effective at reducing the burden of any disease. Unfortunately, such
systemic interventions are among the hardest to achieve.

\#\#\#Special Interventions for Non-human Hosts If one of the hosts is
not a human (e.g., a mosquito vector, or some other animal), it is
possible to use interventions that are not feasible for humans.
Widespread killing of mosquitoes is ethically acceptable (though often
not too effective). The killing of mammals, e.g., culling of dogs in
certain parts of the world to prevent the spread of rabies or other
diseases, is more controversial. For some animals, ethical concerns are
usually not too great (e.g., killing of poultry), but economic
implications can be huge.

\#\#Characteristics of Interventions In addition to grouping
interventions into specific classes as done above, it is also useful to
think about them in terms of their overall characteristics.

\textbf{Temporal/timing characteristics:} While some interventions are
permanent or long-term, e.g., vaccines, sanitation, improved living
standards, other interventions are short-term, such as drug treatment or
quarantine. In general, those interventions with lasting effects are
preferable. However, those are also often the most expensive and
difficult to implement.

\textbf{Target group characteristics:} Another way to distinguish ID
interventions is by the target group. Vaccines are ideally given before
someone becomes infected with the ID. Drugs, on the other hand, are
usually given to infected persons (though pre-exposure prophylaxis is
sometimes used, e.g., for HIV or flu during a pandemic). Quarantine can
be applied to either susceptibles or infected. Measures such as
sanitation improvement affect everyone.

\textbf{Impact level characteristics:} By that, I refer to the primary
target being the individual or the population. The primary goal of drugs
is to help the individual - population level effects as discussed
earlier are secondary. In contrast, quarantine primarily targets
population level impacts. It might not help an individual infected host
if they are quarantined (though ethically, they should receive whatever
support can be provided). Vaccines are also primarily meant to help
protect the individual getting the vaccine. However, the effect of good
vaccines is so powerful that in planning vaccination strategies,
secondary population level effects due to herd immunity are nowadays
taken into account. Interventions such as sanitation almost always
target whole populations (e.g., a village/town/country).

Of course, for many interventions, these categories are not clear-cut
and overlap. Still, it is conceptually useful to think about
interventions in such broad categories. By looking at all the tools
available and assessing their impact and feasibility, one can try to
come up with the best strategy for a given ID and scenario. Such a best
strategy will often involve using more than one method.

\#\#Impact of Interventions We discussed previously that to eradicate a
disease (or prevent local outbreaks) one has to get the effective
reproductive number to just a bit below 1 (of course the lower and
closer to 0, the better). The level of population protection at which
R=1 is called critical herd/population immunity level. The relation
between original/basic reproductive number, intervention coverage, and
effective R is R= R\textsubscript{0}(1-p). That's true if we assume that
the intervention fully protects those to whom it is applied. If instead,
the intervention is not perfect, we have R=R\textsubscript{0}(1-e*p),
where e is the effectiveness of the intervention (e=1 is a perfectly
effective intervention).

By discussing intervention coverage, we assumed that the intervention
was applied to the susceptibles. However, the same idea also applies if
the intervention is applied to infected. Recall that the reproductive
number is given by \(R = D \beta S\). Reducing the fraction of
susceptibles by some intervention reduces \emph{R}. But we can also
reduce \emph{R} by reducing the duration of the infectious period, D, or
the infectiousness/rate at which an infected transmits, \(\beta\).
Quarantining infected is a strategy to reduce \(\beta\), drugs sometimes
can reduce \emph{D} and \(\beta\). For instance, if we can reduce the
duration of the infectious period in the average infected person by
\emph{p}, we get a new effective reproductive number
\(R_{e} = D(1-p) \beta S\). Obviously, the best strategy is one where we
reduce the duration of infection, transmissibility, and number of
susceptibles by some fraction, thus leading to a potentially large
reduction in \emph{R}.

\#\#Interventions and Models Studying the potential impact of
interventions is probably the single most important current use of ID
models. It is often simply not possible to do field studies or
experiments to test the impact of specific intervention strategies. Such
field studies would take a long time, be very costly, be logistically
hard to do, and often be simply unethical: We can't introduce Ebola into
a population, just to see how effective different intervention
strategies might be! Thus, we rely on modeling to investigate
hypothetical scenarios. Models are relatively easy and quick to build
and analyze (at least compared to real field studies), there are no
ethical problems, and we have `full control' over the whole system and
`know everything'. The hope is that if our models are decent
approximations of the real world, we can make informed decisions and
prepare for future outbreaks.

higher than normal case fatality ratio (the often used term case
fatality rate is a bad label as this is not a rate). Once more and
better data became available. It was realized that many infections
initially did not get reported, and adjusting for those it became clear
that the ratio of deaths to infected was thankfully not much different
from seasonal influenza.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-6}}

So far, we tracked hosts concerning their infection status (susceptible,
infected, symptomatic, recovered, etc.). We assumed that hosts are
similar enough with regard to any other characteristics that might
matter for ID dynamics and control that we did not have to consider
them. For instance, we did not account for age, sex, pre-existing
conditions or any other such potentially differentiating detail among
hosts.

That approach is of course at best a decent approximation and at worst
completely wrong. Many characteristics affect how an ID interacts with a
host. For instance, for many ID, children and the elderly are more
likely to get infected and might suffer more severe symptoms. For other
ID, only specific groups are affected. For instance, only sexually
active individuals are at risk of contracting a sexually transmitted
infection (ignoring for a moment less common transmission routes such as
blood transfusion for HIV). We will discuss some of these
differences/heterogeneities between hosts and how they affect ID
transmission and control in this module.

\#\#Types of Host Heterogeneity We generally only care about differences
in hosts as they relate to the infectious disease process. Consider a
simple - maybe silly - example: Almost no infectious disease study (none
that I know of) cares about a person's hair color. That's because this
characteristic has - as far as we are aware - no effect on the
interaction of host and ID. On the other hand, a fundamental feature
that affects many IDs is age. Therefore age often needs to be taken into
account when studying IDs. Other important more broad categories such as
genetics and behavior can also affect ID infection and spread.

Some host characteristics might only have an impact on a single
component of the ID, e.g., the level of susceptibility to infection.
Other host differences can affect multiple components, e.g., a person
with numerous sexual partners is more likely to contract an STI, and if
they are infected, they are also more likely to transmit an STI.

\hypertarget{myexamplebox}{%
\subsubsection{Host Heterogeneity Examples}\label{myexamplebox}}

Several famous examples show how differences in genetics can impact ID.
For instance, persons with a certain mutation of the CCR5 co-receptor on
T-cells are much less likely to get infected with HIV. Similarly,
persons with a particular mutation in the FUT2 gene are much less likely
to get infected with norovirus. It is probable that there are genetic
differences for almost any ID that influence the probability of getting
infected, the severity of symptoms, and the duration and amount of
shedding.

\#\#Heterogeneity in Transmission: Core Groups To study ID transmission
dynamics, differences in the potential and ability of individual hosts
to spread an ID are obviously of great importance. This idea of
heterogeneity in transmission has been studied in several contexts and
under different names. One of the first was the concept of a core group
introduced to explain the persistence of gonorrhea in the 1970s (see
(Yorke, Hethcote, and Nold \protect\hyperlink{ref-yorke78}{1978})). Core
groups are subgroups in which transmission is higher compared to other
groups. For many STI, transmission in the general population is low
enough that the reproductive number is below 1. The question then is,
why does that not lead to the extinction of the ID? The core group
concept provides a reasonable explanation. Where a small but defined
population of individuals maintain the ID with a reproductive number
that is greater than 1. Infections spread from this group to those in
the general population allows the ID to persist in the general
population with a reproductive number less than 1.

Once we have identified that different groups have different
transmission behavior, it also becomes necessary to understand how
individuals belonging to one of the groups interact with people of the
other groups. Often called the \emph{mixing} pattern between groups. We
are most interested in the mixing and contact patterns that facilitate
transmission of the ID under consideration. For instance, it is well
known that humans tend to have more contacts with others of the same
age, e.g., children predominantly contacting other children. This is
called \emph{assortative} mixing, and such age-specific mixing is
important for the transmission of many respiratory diseases. The
opposite is \emph{disassortative} mixing. For instance, for STI, most
mixing occurs between individuals from the opposite sex (and there are
also more contacts among individuals of similar age). Therefore, for
STI, mixing with regard to gender can be considered
\emph{disassortative}. However, it is also known that people who engage
in risky sexual behavior (e.g., more partners per year) tend to have
more contacts with others that engage in similar risk behavior, thus
with regard to transmission and infection risk, STI often show
\emph{assortative} mixing. If there is no mixing preference, it is
called \emph{random} mixing. The \emph{random} mixing assumption is made
implicitly in any model that does not account for contact/transmission
heterogeneity, e.g., the basic SIR model assumes \emph{random} mixing
and contact patterns between susceptible and infected, independent of
any other characteristic. Determining the mixing patterns between
individuals is important but also difficult. For some research in that
area, see, e.g. (Edmunds et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-edmunds06}{2006};
Mossong et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-mossong08}{2008}).

\#\#Heterogeneity in Transmission: Superspreaders An equivalent concept
to that of the core group, but applied to individuals, is known by the
term superspreaders. Superspreaders are individuals who spread/transmit
an ID much more than the \emph{average} infected person. It turns out
that for most ID, the number of secondary transmissions produced by the
average infected person is not too meaningful. Such a measure would be a
good description if the distribution of secondary infections were close
to normal (or Poisson), with most infected individuals infecting similar
numbers of others. However, what is often observed is a heavily skewed
distribution, with most individuals infecting none or only a few others,
and a few individuals infecting many others (Galvani and May
\protect\hyperlink{ref-galvani05}{2005}).

\#\#Heterogeneity and The Reproductive Number If we have multiple host
types, we need to extend the idea of the reproductive number. While it
is possible to compute a reproductive number for the overall population,
this quantity might not tell the full story. Instead, we might want to
look at the reproductive number for subsets of the population, for
instance for the general population (non-superspreaders) and core groups
(the superspreaders). If one wants to compute an overall reproductive
number, one needs to account for the population heterogeneity by
including a measure of the variability of contacts in the equation for
the reproductive number. See, (May, Gupta, and McLean
\protect\hyperlink{ref-may01}{2001}) for a discussion of this topic.

\#\#Heterogeneity and ID control Heterogeneity among hosts concerning
their susceptibility, infectiousness, and severity has direct
implications for control. If we know who is most likely to transmit, who
is most likely to have a severe case of a disease, and who is most
likely to catch an ID in the first place, we can implement targeted
control strategies. For instance, instead of vaccinating people at
random, we could target those that are most vulnerable to getting the
ID, or those most likely to infect others if they were to get infected.
The better we can target the intervention, the more impact they can
have, and while also getting more `bang for our buck'.

\#\#Modeling Heterogeneity The basic concept of including host
heterogeneity in models is relatively straightforward. We stratify the
population according to the characteristic we want to take into account.
For instance, instead of lumping everyone into
susceptible-infected-recovered categories, we can track males and
females, or children and adults, separately. Figure
\ref{fig:heterogeneity} illustrates this.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/heterogeneityexample.png}
\caption{\label{fig:heterogeneity}Example of including host heterogeneity in
an SIR model.}
\end{figure}

The challenges with including more details in the model are not
conceptual but are instead logistical and potentially technical. Bigger
models are harder to formulate, implement, and analyze. Additionally, we
need estimates of model parameters with regard to the stratifying
characteristics, which are often hard to get. Because of that, it is
often best to start with a simple model, and slowly introduce host
characteristics as they are deemed relevant to the ID setting, and
question one wants to address.

At some point, if we want to include a lot of detail, it might be worth
switching the modeling framework. For compartmental models, hosts are
grouped according to characteristics. As we want to track more
characteristics, the number of compartments we need to include
increases. If the basic model has C compartments/variables, P
parameters, and we model N subpopulations, we have C x N equations and
at least P x N (or more) parameters. For instance, if we had a basic
SEIR model (4 compartments), and wanted to track males and females in 4
different age groups, we had 4 x 2 x 4 = 32 compartments. If we had
additional compartments to follow say vaccination or treatment status,
one could end up with more than 50 compartments, sometimes even going
into the hundreds.

Once the number of compartments gets too large, it might then be worth
deciding to stop using compartmental models and instead switch to a type
of model that is called agent or individual-based model (ABM/IBM). In
such models, the individual host is modeled and tracked. We can give
everyone as many different characteristics as we want. This makes the
model very flexible and potentially very realistic. The downside of
these ABM is that they tend to be more complicated than compartmental
models, are generally much harder to code, and often take a long time to
run, especially if one wants to model a large population. Further, for
detailed models, lots of parameter estimates are needed, and they are
often not available, leading to potentially large uncertainty in model
predictions. Also, it 's hard to make any statistical inference with
ABM. Because of these disadvantages, the compartmental modeling
framework is still the most frequently used and a good starting point
for most situations and questions. For IDs where we know a lot and want
detailed predictions (e.g., influenza), ABMs are becoming more common.

heterogeneity, how to consider it in studies, and its impact on
transmission and control. We also discussed how to include heterogeneity
into models.

\#\#Overview and Learning Objectives In this chapter, we will discuss
scenarios where more than one infectious disease is considered
simultaneously.

The learning objectives for this chapter are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Know important multi-ID systems
\item
  Understand how IDs can interact
\end{itemize}

\#\#Introduction So far, we focused on a single ID at a time. The main
reason for this is simplicity. A single ID is already difficult to study
and leads to complex dynamics. It makes sense to first study and
understand individual IDs before including further IDs. That said, there
are always many pathogens present at the same time, and infection with
more than one ID is very common (Petney and Andrews
\protect\hyperlink{ref-petney98}{1998}). This is true in the developed
world with a fairly low ID burden, and even more so in developing
countries. It is thus often useful to consider systems with more than
one ID.

\#\#Interactions of ID Sometimes, different IDs do not interact, i.e.,
being infected with one does not impact the susceptibility or course of
infection for another ID. It is likely that some amount of interaction
occurs for almost all IDs, mediated by the immune response or through
other mechanisms such as a change in host behavior or host death (Rohani
et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-rohani03}{2003}). However, unless the IDs
are relatively common and the interaction effect is strong, it is often
hard to determine if and how IDs affect each other. As such, we know how
some IDs interact (e.g., TB and HIV) but for most ID, we have very
little knowledge. The next few sections briefly discuss some IDs for
which we have some understanding regarding interactions. This is not an
exhaustive discussion. Instead, we focus on some of the best-known
interactions.

\#\#\#HIV-TB Interactions HIV is the pathogen that is best studied with
regard to interaction with other pathogens (Karp and Auwaerter
\protect\hyperlink{ref-karp07}{2007}\protect\hyperlink{ref-karp07}{a},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-karp07a}{2007}\protect\hyperlink{ref-karp07a}{b};
Griffiths et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-griffiths11}{2011}). Arguably of
most public health interest and concern is the interaction with TB.
Having an (untreated) HIV infection makes it much more likely for an
individual latently infected with TB to develop TB disease. Further,
once TB disease develops, an individual who is also infected with HIV
has worse symptoms and a much higher chance of dying (Pawlowski et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pawlowski12}{2012}). An important current
question that is still not fully answered is if the suppression of HIV
by antiretroviral therapy treatment removes all detrimental effects of
HIV on TB progression, or if the presence of HIV, albeit at minuscule
levels, still has a negative impact on TB disease progression.

\#\#\#HIV-Hepatitis Interactions Persons infected with HIV are also
often at risk of having HBV or HCV infections. The primary reason for
this is that risk factors for these pathogens are very similar (e.g.,
drug use) (Sulkowski \protect\hyperlink{ref-sulkowski08}{2008}).
Co-infection leads to faster rate of liver failure (Chen, Feeney, and
Chung \protect\hyperlink{ref-chen14}{2014}). If HBV or HCV leads to more
rapid progression to AIDS and HIV-mediated death is unclear (Kim and
Chung \protect\hyperlink{ref-kim09}{2009}). It seems that with
antiretroviral therapy and the new drugs against viral hepatitis, the
impact of this co-infection on health can be minimized.

\#\#\#Influenza-Strep Interactions The interaction of influenza with
some bacteria and most notably \emph{Streptococcus pneumoniae} has been
somewhat well studied (McCullers
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mccullers06}{2006}). Some careful animal
experiments, as well as modeling studies, have shown how influenza
interacts with bacteria co-infections (A. M. Smith and McCullers
\protect\hyperlink{ref-smith14a}{2014}; Shrestha et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-shrestha13}{2013}). In general, an influenza
infection seems to make it more likely - during a short time window - to
have a subsequent bacterial infection, and the outcome of the bacterial
infection is often worse. It is still not well understood if there is
also an effect of a respiratory bacterial infection on a potential
secondary influenza infection (Davis et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-davis12}{2012}).

\#\#More Than Two Infectious Diseases While not much is known about
interactions between any two ID (apart from the examples just described
and a few others), even less is known for 2+ ID. It is fair to say that
given our current level of knowledge about the biology and epidemiology
of various ID, understanding interactions and dynamics of multiple ID is
beyond our current scope, and will likely remain so for a while.

\#\#Multiple ID and Control If multiple IDs are present, it makes sense
to try and implement control strategies against as many of them as
possible. This is true for diseases which interact or are independent.
Unfortunately, given the way health systems are structured and funded,
it is still often the case that interventions target a single ID at a
time. E.g., a campaign against malaria focuses solely on malaria
treatment, even though many of the patients probably also have TB or
some helminth infections and should be tested and treated for those
diseases at the same time. The one important exception is HIV. Often HIV
testing and treatment is included even if a study or health campaign
focuses on a different disease. Having a more wide-spread multi-ID
approach to control would very likely be highly effective since, for
many ID, individuals who are likely to get infected with one are also
likely to get infected with other ID. This is because many IDs have the
same risk factors for transmission from poor nutrition or unsanitary
conditions to particular behaviors that increase the risk for multiple
IDs. One could, therefore, efficiently find and effectively treat many
different IDs. Public health is slowly moving this direction.

Some ways in which multiple IDs are controlled are almost accidental. It
is well known that better education, better nutrition, better standard
of living, improved sanitation and housing all reduce morbidity and
mortality to a large number of diseases. As developing countries become
richer and people escape extreme poverty, the incidence of many IDs
fall. This is the trajectory many developed countries were on, e.g., TB
incidence in Europe was falling rapidly even before the introduction of
anti-TB drugs. As more countries become developed, the ID burden will
decline (and likely with it, ``wealth diseases'' like obesity will
rise).

The approach to modeling multiple ID is similar to that of host
heterogeneity: We need to split/stratify the population according to
infection status of each ID. The complicated part is modeling any
potential interactions between IDs correctly. As mentioned previously,
more compartments the more complex the model becomes. Making it harder
to code, analyze, and we need estimates for each parameter, which are
often hard to get. Because of that, considering/modeling more than 2 ID
is still almost never done - but many critical 2-ID modeling studies
exist. Figure \ref{fig:coinfection} shows the diagram for a 2 ID model.

extinction.

\hypertarget{introduction-7}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-7}}

So far, all the models we have used to explore different aspects of ID
dynamics have been \emph{deterministic}. For a deterministic model, once
you choose the initial conditions and parameter values, you always get
the same result, no matter how often you run the model. There is no
randomness present. Biological systems are never deterministic. There is
always some amount of randomness or noise present. Models that allow for
such randomness are called stochastic models. We discuss here when it is
important to consider stochastic models and some of the questions one
can only study with those models.

\hypertarget{deterministic-systems}{%
\section{Deterministic systems}\label{deterministic-systems}}

Such deterministic models are relatively easy to implement and to study.
That is one of the reasons they are so commonly used. Such a modeling
approach also often provides a good representation of the dynamics of
real ID if numbers are large. That is due to the law of large numbers.
While every individual host or pathogen undergoes somewhat random
dynamics, these random parts get \emph{averaged out}, and the dynamics
of the whole population is fairly predictable and well described by such
deterministic models. (This is the same concept we use in classical
epidemiological studies, where we enroll sufficiently large numbers such
that we can say something predictable about differences between groups,
even if individuals are somewhat unpredictable.)

\hypertarget{stochasticity}{%
\section{Stochasticity}\label{stochasticity}}

Biological systems are never deterministic. When numbers are small,
randomness starts to matter. As an example, consider an outbreak of some
ID. Let's say we have a group of 100 infected. At a given time, some of
them will transmit to others, and after that, they will recover from the
disease, while others will recover before infecting others. The overall
outbreak dynamics can be well approximated by a deterministic model if
we accurately specify the average rate of transmission and the average
rate of recovery. In contrast, now assume that there is a single
infected person. Now it makes a huge difference if this person transmits
to someone else before recovering, or if they recover before
transmission occurs. In the latter case, the outbreak is over, and the
ID has gone extinct. Thus, at small numbers, randomness/unpredictability
in the order of events can make a large difference.

\hypertarget{discrete-numbers-and-extinctions}{%
\section{Discrete Numbers and
Extinctions}\label{discrete-numbers-and-extinctions}}

Another problem inherent in the deterministic differential equation
based models we have looked at so far is that they treat individuals in
each compartment as continuous. For instance, the models allow 142.7
infected hosts. Of course, in reality, those numbers have to be
integers. If we are dealing with large numbers, the difference between
142.7 and 142 or 143 is minor and doesn't matter. However, once numbers
get small, the fact that we are dealing with discrete numbers of hosts
becomes significant. So once less than 1 host has an infection the ID is
in reality gone, but a continuous model would instead allow the number
of infected to drop below 1 but remain above 0. In this way, the ID in
the continuous models never actually goes extinct, it only gets closer
and closer to 0 (and at some point is so close to 0 that the computer
can't distinguish it from 0 anymore).

\#\#Modeling Stochasticity and Extinction To capture both the randomness
and discrete nature of real systems requires a slightly different
modeling approach. We can still use compartmental models, i.e., we track
total numbers of individuals in particular states (e.g., S-I-R). But
now, instead of letting the numbers in each compartment change
continuously through inflows and outflows, changes happen in discrete
steps, determined by specific events that occur in a probabilistic
manner.

As an example, instead of new susceptible hosts entering the system at
some continuous birth rate, we now model births occurring as discrete
events. Each birth event leads to an increase in the number of
susceptibles by 1. The timing of the birth events is somewhat random,
with an overall probability determined by the model (e.g., a higher
birth rate will mean births occur more frequently, but still randomly).

\hypertarget{factors-affecting-extinction}{%
\section{Factors Affecting
Extinction}\label{factors-affecting-extinction}}

Extinction of ID is of interest because that is often our final goal. We
would like to drive an ID to extinction, either locally or even better,
globally. If and how an ID can be driven to extinction depends on
different factors. For IDs in humans, the only real chance is to tackle
those with no other hosts or reservoirs. As such, we will likely never
be able to eradicate influenza. But measles eradication might be
possible (though hard).

Factors related to the host population and distinct ID characteristics
influence the likelihood of an ID to go extinct. Two significant
population factors are the size of the host population and the speed at
which new susceptible hosts are replenished. Important characteristics
of the ID included the infectiousness, the duration of the latent and
infectious periods, the ability of the ID to persist outside the host,
and other.

\hypertarget{critical-community-size}{%
\section{Critical Community Size}\label{critical-community-size}}

The minimum size of a population at which an ID can maintain itself in a
population without extinction has been termed the Critical Community
Size (CCS) (this also depends on the replenishment of new susceptibles,
e.g., birth rates). Studies for measles suggested that the CCS was
several hundred thousand (Keeling and Grenfell
\protect\hyperlink{ref-keeling02}{2002}), meaning that measles could
have only become a human pathogen once human populations were large
enough to maintain it. The CCS is the number of susceptibles in a
population and does not include those who are immune. Through
vaccinating it is possible to reduce the size of the susceptible
population below the CCS. So it is not necessary to vaccinate everyone
to get an ID to go extinct. We just need to reach enough individuals to
get the population of susceptibles below the critical level. This task
is already hard by itself, as evidenced by the fact that we have not
been able to eradicate measles, despite having a good vaccine.

\hypertarget{host-extinction}{%
\section{Host Extinction}\label{host-extinction}}

Another way an ID can go extinct is if its hosts go extinct - either due
to mortality from the ID or other causes. For most human diseases, such
host extinction is fortunately not very common - though highly lethal ID
such as Ebola can lead to marked reduction in the number of hosts in a
given population. For non-human disease, extinctions of hosts due to
disease is a more significant issue. Here, conversation efforts might
try to achieve non-extinction of the host and - ideally - extinction of
the ID.

The host extinction approach is also often considered and used for
vector-borne diseases. Here, the idea is to drive one of the hosts
(commonly called the vector) to extinction. The obvious reasoning is
that if there are fewer vectors (e.g., mosquitoes), the chances for
humans to get infected are lower. Widespread use of DDT or
insecticide-coated bed-nets are examples of this. A similar but more
controversial approach is the attempted control of rabies in humans by
killing its primary host, vampire-bats (Stoner-Duncan, Streicker, and
Tedeschi \protect\hyperlink{ref-stoner-duncan14}{2014}).

\hypertarget{disease-emergence}{%
\section{Disease Emergence}\label{disease-emergence}}

The flip-side of extinction is the emergence of a new disease. During
extinction, infected/pathogen numbers move from a level that can be
decently approximated by a deterministic model to numbers so small that
it requires a stochastic analysis approach to allow the possibility of
extinction. During emergence, the new disease starts at zero, then is
introduced in modest numbers (possibly only a single introduction) into
a new population, and ``bounces around'' for a while in small numbers.
If conditions are right (i.e., local reproductive number greater than
1), the disease might take off and spread. It might eventually reach
high enough numbers that a deterministic approximation which focuses on
the mean dynamics is warranted. To understand emerging infectious
diseases, one needs to account for evolutionary dynamics. Both are an
important topics in infectious disease epidemiology and will considered
in detail in the next few chapters.

\section{Are stochastic models
better?}\label{are-stochastic-models-better}}

After having gone through this chapter and learned that stochastic
models allow you to address questions that deterministic models cannot
address, you might wonder why we should still use deterministic models
at all. The main reasons are that deterministic models are generally
easier to build, easier to analyze, faster to run on a computer, and
importantly, much easier to fit to data. Often this simplicity is worth
the loss in some level of realism. But of course, it depends on the
specific scenario and question. Recall the example of different maps in
a chapter \ref{idstates}. The right map depends on the question.
Similarly, the most appropriate model depends on your question. For some
questions, stochastic models are needed. For others, deterministic
models might still be the better choice.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-8}}

Evolution is based on the generation of diversity, usually genetic
diversity through mutations and the subsequent increase or decrease in
certain genetic variants through selection or random drift.
Microorganisms, especially viruses, tend to undergo rapid evolutionary
change. High mutation rates and large population sizes provide many
opportunities for the generation of genotypic and phenotypic diversity.
Short generation times and fluctuations in population size (e.g.,
through transmission bottlenecks) allow selection to quickly act on this
diversity, amplifying those mutants that have a fitness advantage and
eliminating those with low fitness. These features of microbial
populations often lead to rapid evolutionary changes. Such evolutionary
change can become a public health problem.

<<<<<<< HEAD
\hypertarget{basics-of-evolutionary-dynamics}{%
\section{Basics of Evolutionary
dynamics}\label{basics-of-evolutionary-dynamics}}

Two main mechanisms underly evolutionary dynamics: First, diversity
needs to be generated.

Second, newly created mutants undergo \emph{selection}. Depending on the
phenotype of the mutant and the environment, it might be more or less
fit than the wild-type (e.g.~grow better inside a host or transmit
better between hosts). Depending on this fitness

Another process is drift. Even if a mutant has lowe or higher fitness
than the wild-type.

These two processes are often labeled `mutation' and `selection'. In
that terminology, mutation includes processes such as point mutation,
recombination, etc.

The mutation process is generally stochastic, new mutants are generated
at random. For most organisms, this also occurs at a fixed rate,
independent of the setting. An exception are some bacteria that are
thought to be able to increase generation of new mutants in response to
environmental factors REFS.

The selection process is potentially less random and more predictable.

In general (apart from the possible phenomenon of drug-induced
hypermutation in bacteria), the generation of genetic variants is not
influenced by any human intervention. Those mutants are constantly
produced. In the usual setting, most mutants are less fit than the
wild-type strain and therefore are outcompeted. If not, they replace the
current strain and become the new wild-type.

\hypertarget{evolution-and-immune-escape}{%
\section{Evolution and Immune
Escape}\label{evolution-and-immune-escape}}

A powerful driver of evolution is the host immune response. If an ID
induces a strong immune response which subsequently protects the host
from re-infection, a mutant of the ID which can partially escape the
host immunity and infect a host will have a large fitness advantage.
This is the process which drives the continuous evolution of influenza
in humans. It is likely also the driver for changes in many other
diseases, especially viruses. Why some pathogens do not seem to evolve
much to circumvent immune response (measles is a good example) is not
quite clear, though some studies have speculated on that topic (Frank
and Bush \protect\hyperlink{ref-frank07}{2007}; Lange and Ferguson
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lange09}{2009}).

\#\#Modeling Evolutionary Dynamics To study evolutionary dynamics, we
will need to implement models that allow for changes in the system on
top of the non-evolutionary dynamics of the ID. Unless we plan to model
many different potential new variants, it is often easiest to
pre-specify the number of variants we want to track. In the simplest
form where we only track pathogen evolution, we might model the
wild-type (normal, pre-existing) form of the pathogen and a single
mutant that is different in some important characteristic, e.g.,
resistant to a drug or able to evade a vaccine. We would build a model
with these compartments. We often also pre-specify the characteristics
(i.e., the parameter values) for both the wild-type and mutant. We
implement the process of mutant generation in the model and run the
simulation. Under certain circumstances, we might see the mutant be
generated and take over the population.

If we want to model many different mutants, maybe allowing for random,
not pre-specified, differences in their fitness, and perhaps even
allowing for host evolution, the models get quite a bit more
complicated. They are not necessarily conceptually harder, but there is
more bookkeeping and coding involved making it technically trickier.

\hypertarget{co-evolution}{%
\section{Co-evolution}\label{co-evolution}}

While the hosts infected by ID also evolve, this usually happens on much
slower time-scales. As such, studying evolution by assuming only the ID
evolves and not the host is often a good approximation. However, there
are examples where host evolution needs to be considered. A good example
is the introduction of myxoma virus to control Australian rabbit
populations. Evolution of both the virus and rabbits was observed. Over
longer time-scales, features such as sickle cell anemia, which comes
from a mutation that is associated with reduced malaria morbidity, is
likely a trait some humans evolved in response to malaria. A discussion
of genetic characteristics in humans that might be attributable to
evolution in response to specific infectious diseases is provided in
(Pittman et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-pittman16}{2016}).

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-9}}

Some of the most potent drivers of evolution are the very same control
strategies we have developed to try to reduce the burden of an ID. The
more powerful the intervention, the more evolutionary pressure a
pathogen faces and the more advantaged a pathogen variant that is
partially or entirely resistant to the intervention will be.

The following sections discuss several drivers of public health
importance that influence the selective fitness of different genetic
variants and thereby drive ID-evolution.

What happens in the presence of interventions is that the fitness
landscape changes. For instance, if we give a patient drugs, a mutant
resistant to drugs with a fitness less than the wild-type in the absence
of drug treatment has a significant advantage and can outcompete the
wild-type strain.

\hypertarget{vaccine-escape}{%
\section{Vaccine Escape}\label{vaccine-escape}}

Vaccines are some of our most potent interventions. Vaccination induces
immunity in the vaccinated hosts. If a pathogen can circumvent immunity
and infected vaccinated individuals, it will have a large fitness
advantage. Therefore, any mutation that arises which allows a pathogen
to reduce the impact of host immunity will likely spread through a
population quickly. Most immunity works through antibodies. Thus
pathogen variants that evolve not to be (or less) recognized by
pre-existing antibodies have an advantage. This is the same mechanism
induced by natural immunity. Thus, pathogens that frequently evolve to
escape natural antibody-based immunity (e.g., influenza, HIV) are also
able to develop resistance to vaccine-induced immunity. This is the
reason we need to get re-immunized with influenza vaccines regularly and
why we have not managed to develop an HIV vaccine. In contrast, an ID
like measles which does not seem to be able to escape natural immunity
also does not evolve resistance to the vaccine, and we can use the same
vaccine against measles we have been using for decades.

Diseases}\label{emerging-infectious-diseases}}

\#\#Overview and Learning Objectives In this chapter, we will take a
look at the evolutionary processes underlying the emergence of new
Infectious Diseases.
=======
These two processes are often labeled `mutation' and `selection'. In
that terminology, mutation includes processes such as point mutation,
recombination, etc.

The mutation process is generally stochastic, new mutants are generated
at random. For most organisms, this also occurs at a fixed rate,
independent of the setting. An exception are some bacteria that are
thought to be able to increase generation of new mutants in response to
environmental factors REFS.

The selection process is potentially less random and more predictable.

In general (apart from the possible phenomenon of drug-induced
hypermutation in bacteria), the generation of genetic variants is not
influenced by any human intervention. Those mutants are constantly
produced. In the usual setting, most mutants are less fit than the
wild-type strain and therefore are outcompeted. If not, they replace the
current strain and become the new wild-type.

\section{Evolution and Immune Escape}\label{evolution-and-immune-escape}

A powerful driver of evolution is the host immune response. If an ID
induces a strong immune response which subsequently protects the host
from re-infection, a mutant of the ID which can partially escape the
host immunity and infect a host will have a large fitness advantage.
This is the process which drives the continuous evolution of influenza
in humans. It is likely also the driver for changes in many other
diseases, especially viruses. Why some pathogens do not seem to evolve
much to circumvent immune response (measles is a good example) is not
quite clear, though some studies have speculated on that topic (Frank
and Bush \protect\hyperlink{ref-frank07}{2007}; Lange and Ferguson
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lange09}{2009}).

\end{itemize}

\#\#Introduction The definition of emerging infectious disease (EID) is
a bit vague, but in general a pathogen that is `new' to a specific
population can be considered an EID. A `new' pathogen can mean a
genuinely new one (e.g.~SARS or MERS-CoV in humans), or a new variant of
an existing pathogen (e.g.~the 2009 H1N1 influenza that caused a
pandemic, or drug resistant Staph Aureus). In each case, there is
usually a mix of deterministic drivers (e.g.~changes in climate,
population density, antibiotic use) and random chance that lead to the
emergence of new diseases.

\#\#Emergence and Evolution The word `emergence' describes what is
observed, a new disease shows up for the first time (emerges) in a
population. This emergence is almost always linked to evolutionary
processes. For instance, a pathogen that is already in the human
population evolves drug resistance. Or a new pathogen is introduced into
the human population and then undergoes evolution to adapt to the new
host. While one could define emergence as the phenomenon and evolution
as the mechanism, in practice, you will often find these terms used
interchangeably, and the exact meaning will depend on how the author
defines it. In this chapter, we will discuss both the mechanisms of
evolution and how they can lead to the emergence of new pathogens. The
ability to understand and predict the emergence of new IDs is, of
course, of vital importance, recent references providing additional
information are (Brett, Drake, and Rohani
\protect\hyperlink{ref-brett17}{2017}; Dibble et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-dibble16}{2016}).

\#\#Ecological drivers of evolution and emergence Many external,
ecological factors affect ID dynamics. Weather, climate, vegetation, the
abundance and density of hosts and other species, nutritional status,
and general living conditions are all important factors influencing
human and animal ID. This is true both for short-term dynamics (e.g.,
weather patterns can affect disease incidence) as well as for the
long-term evolutionary dynamics. The emergence of many new viral
pathogens among humans (e.g., HIV, SARS, MERS) is likely caused by the
closer contact humans have with the animals who are the main hosts of
those diseases. Transmission in these situations of close human-animal
contact is often called spillover. Similarly, as discussed in the
previous chapter, measles and other diseases were only able to emerge
and establish themselves among humans once human populations became
large enough. As global warming will affect climate and as people become
more affluent and urbanized, we can expect further changes in ID
dynamics and evolution over the next decades - though predicting what
changes exactly will occur, and which diseases might increase and
decrease in importance is very difficult (Altizer et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-altizer13}{2013}).

\#\#Emergence dynamics During the process of emergence, the new disease
is initially - by definition - not present (or at least not detectable
by our surveillance methods). Initially a small number of new hosts are
infected by the new disease. The disease ``bounces around'' for a while
with few transmission events and overall low numbers. If conditions are
right (the local reproductive number is greater than 1), the disease
might take off and spread. Once it has spread enough that our
surveillance systems notice it, we consider this new disease as having
emerged in that population. The newly emerged (observed) disease can
then either be brought under control relatively quickly (e.g.~2003 SARS
outbreak), or with much effort (e.g.~2014 Ebola outbreak), or not be
fully controlled but continue at a low level (e.g.~MERS-CoV) or
uncontrolled and spreading widely (e.g.~2009 influenza pandemic).

\#\#Modeling ID Emergence Dynamics To study evolutionary dynamics, we
will need to implement models that allow for changes in the system on
top of the non-evolutionary dynamics of the ID. Unless we plan to model
many different potential new variants, it is often easiest to
pre-specify the number of variants we want to track. In the simplest
form where we only track pathogen evolution, we might model the
wild-type (normal, pre-existing) form of the pathogen and a single
mutant that is different in some important characteristic, e.g.,
resistant to a drug or able to evade a vaccine. We would build a model
with these compartments. We often also pre-specify the characteristics
(i.e., the parameter values) for both the wild-type and mutant. We
implement the process of mutant generation in the model and run the
simulation. Under certain circumstances, we might see the mutant be
generated and take over the population.

If we want to model many different mutants, maybe allowing for random,
not pre-specified, differences in their fitness, and perhaps even
allowing for host evolution, the models get quite a bit more
complicated. They are not necessarily conceptually harder, but there is
more bookkeeping and coding involved making it technically trickier.

\section{Co-evolution}\label{co-evolution}

While the hosts infected by ID also evolve, this usually happens on much
slower time-scales. As such, studying evolution by assuming only the ID
evolves and not the host is often a good approximation. However, there
are examples where host evolution needs to be considered. A good example
is the introduction of myxoma virus to control Australian rabbit
populations. Evolution of both the virus and rabbits was observed. Over
longer time-scales, features such as sickle cell anemia, which comes
from a mutation that is associated with reduced malaria morbidity, is
likely a trait some humans evolved in response to malaria. A discussion
of genetic characteristics in humans that might be attributable to
evolution in response to specific infectious diseases is provided in
(Pittman et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-pittman16}{2016}).

\section{Overview and Learning
Objectives}\label{overview-and-learning-objectives-14}

In this chapter, we will discuss how control of infectious diseases can
induce strong evolutionary pressure and how this often leads to unwanted
results.

The learning objectives for this chapter are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Understand how control measures affect pathogen fitness
\item
  Assess the impact of different control measures on potential for
  evolution
\item
  Know about similarities and differences in certain ID control
  strategies
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-14}

Some of the most potent drivers of evolution are the very same control
strategies we have developed to try to reduce the burden of an ID. The
more powerful the intervention, the more evolutionary pressure a
pathogen faces and the more advantaged a pathogen variant that is
partially or entirely resistant to the intervention will be.

The following sections discuss several drivers of public health
importance that influence the selective fitness of different genetic
variants and thereby drive ID-evolution.

What happens in the presence of interventions is that the fitness
landscape changes. For instance, if we give a patient drugs, a mutant
resistant to drugs with a fitness less than the wild-type in the absence
of drug treatment has a significant advantage and can outcompete the
wild-type strain.

\section{Vaccine Escape}\label{vaccine-escape}

Vaccines are some of our most potent interventions. Vaccination induces
immunity in the vaccinated hosts. If a pathogen can circumvent immunity
and infected vaccinated individuals, it will have a large fitness
advantage. Therefore, any mutation that arises which allows a pathogen
to reduce the impact of host immunity will likely spread through a
population quickly. Most immunity works through antibodies. Thus
pathogen variants that evolve not to be (or less) recognized by
pre-existing antibodies have an advantage. This is the same mechanism
induced by natural immunity. Thus, pathogens that frequently evolve to
escape natural antibody-based immunity (e.g., influenza, HIV) are also
able to develop resistance to vaccine-induced immunity. This is the
reason we need to get re-immunized with influenza vaccines regularly and
why we have not managed to develop an HIV vaccine. In contrast, an ID
like measles which does not seem to be able to escape natural immunity
also does not evolve resistance to the vaccine, and we can use the same
vaccine against measles we have been using for decades.

The reason why measles might not be able to escape binding by
pre-existing antibodies is likely because the binding site is also the
part of the virus that is needed to attach to and enter host cells. Any
mutation evading antibody binding would also lead to an inability to
attach to and infect cells. In contrast, for influenza, the antibody
binding regions and the receptor attachment regions are somewhat
distinct.

\section{Drug Resistance}\label{drug-resistance}

Drugs are another mechanism that applies a strong selective pressure.
Any pathogen that can avoid being killed by a drug can potentially `take
over' a patient and transmit to the next. If drug use is widespread in
the population, those resistant mutants which generally have lower
fitness than the wild-type, drug-sensitive strain can take over in a
population. This phenomenon has been observed with many different ID and
drugs and produced such looming public health problems as extensively
drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) (Levy and Marshall \protect\hyperlink{ref-levy04}{2004}).
Since viruses tend to evolve faster than bacteria, drug resistance
evolution is often a problem at the individual patient level. HIV is the
prime example. Single-drug therapy for HIV fails consistently because
the virus quickly evolved resistance. Only once we started using
multiple drugs at the same time were we able to prevent rapid evolution.
We are playing a `numbers game' since the chance of 3 resistance
mutations against 3 different drugs occurring is so small that it rarely
happens during the treatment of an individual host, thus making the
drugs effective for the host's lifetime. Since drug resistance is such
an important public health problem, it is widely studied. This includes
many modeling studies. For an overview of some of those, see (Louz et
al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-louz10}{2010}; Temime et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-temime08}{2008}; Wiesch et al.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-10}}

Many pathogens harm their hosts, some in small amounts (e.g.~a runny
nose), some in large amounts (e.g.~death). The question of why that is
the case is
=======
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-15}

The definition of emerging infectious disease (EID) is a bit vague, but
in general a pathogen that is `new' to a specific population can be
considered an EID. A `new' pathogen can mean a genuinely new one
(e.g.~SARS or MERS-CoV in humans), or a new variant of an existing
pathogen (e.g.~the 2009 H1N1 influenza that caused a pandemic, or drug
resistant Staph Aureus). In each case, there is usually a mix of
deterministic drivers (e.g.~changes in climate, population density,
antibiotic use) and random chance that lead to the emergence of new
diseases.

\section{Emergence and Evolution}\label{emergence-and-evolution}

The word `emergence' describes what is observed, a new disease shows up
for the first time (emerges) in a population. This emergence is almost
always linked to evolutionary processes. For instance, a pathogen that
is already in the human population evolves drug resistance. Or a new
pathogen is introduced into the human population and then undergoes
evolution to adapt to the new host. While one could define emergence as
the phenomenon and evolution as the mechanism, in practice, you will
often find these terms used interchangeably, and the exact meaning will
depend on how the author defines it. In this chapter, we will discuss
both the mechanisms of evolution and how they can lead to the emergence
of new pathogens. The ability to understand and predict the emergence of
new IDs is, of course, of vital importance, recent references providing
additional information are (Brett, Drake, and Rohani
\protect\hyperlink{ref-brett17}{2017}; Dibble et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-dibble16}{2016}).

\section{Ecological drivers of evolution and
emergence}\label{ecological-drivers-of-evolution-and-emergence}

Many external, ecological factors affect ID dynamics. Weather, climate,
vegetation, the abundance and density of hosts and other species,
nutritional status, and general living conditions are all important
factors influencing human and animal ID. This is true both for
short-term dynamics (e.g., weather patterns can affect disease
incidence) as well as for the long-term evolutionary dynamics. The
emergence of many new viral pathogens among humans (e.g., HIV, SARS,
MERS) is likely caused by the closer contact humans have with the
animals who are the main hosts of those diseases. Transmission in these
situations of close human-animal contact is often called spillover.
Similarly, as discussed in the previous chapter, measles and other
diseases were only able to emerge and establish themselves among humans
once human populations became large enough. As global warming will
affect climate and as people become more affluent and urbanized, we can
expect further changes in ID dynamics and evolution over the next
decades - though predicting what changes exactly will occur, and which
diseases might increase and decrease in importance is very difficult
(Altizer et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-altizer13}{2013}).

\section{Emergence dynamics}\label{emergence-dynamics}

During the process of emergence, the new disease is initially - by
definition - not present (or at least not detectable by our surveillance
methods). Initially a small number of new hosts are infected by the new
disease. The disease ``bounces around'' for a while with few
transmission events and overall low numbers. If conditions are right
(the local reproductive number is greater than 1), the disease might
take off and spread. Once it has spread enough that our surveillance
systems notice it, we consider this new disease as having emerged in
that population. The newly emerged (observed) disease can then either be
brought under control relatively quickly (e.g.~2003 SARS outbreak), or
with much effort (e.g.~2014 Ebola outbreak), or not be fully controlled
but continue at a low level (e.g.~MERS-CoV) or uncontrolled and
spreading widely (e.g.~2009 influenza pandemic).

\section{Modeling ID Emergence
Dynamics}\label{modeling-id-emergence-dynamics}

To study evolutionary dynamics, we will need to implement models that
allow for changes in the system on top of the non-evolutionary dynamics
of the ID. Unless we plan to model many different potential new
variants, it is often easiest to pre-specify the number of variants we
want to track. In the simplest form where we only track pathogen
evolution, we might model the wild-type (normal, pre-existing) form of
the pathogen and a single mutant that is different in some important
characteristic, e.g., resistant to a drug or able to evade a vaccine. We
would build a model with these compartments. We often also pre-specify
the characteristics (i.e., the parameter values) for both the wild-type
and mutant. We implement the process of mutant generation in the model
and run the simulation. Under certain circumstances, we might see the
mutant be generated and take over the population.

\section{Virulence definition}\label{virulence-definition}}

<<<<<<< HEAD
The term virulence is a bit fuzzy, but it generally means `harm to the
host'. That could be due to mortality caused by an ID, or in less severe
forms, ID-related morbidity (sickness/symptoms).

\section{Summary and Cartoon}\label{summary-and-cartoon-15}

\hypertarget{virulence-evolution}{%
\section{Virulence evolution}\label{virulence-evolution}}

Pathogens `don't care' about harming their hosts, their primary
`purpose' is to get in, replicate, and get back out and infect the next
host. Sometimes, inducing some morbidity in the host is useful for the
pathogen. Sneezing and coughing for respiratory infections might lead to
enhanced transmission and therefore increased pathogen fitness. In other
situations, inducing morbidity/mortality doesn't increase pathogen
fitness, but it also doesn't decrease it. Therefore, selection doesn't
act to change the number of symptoms induced. Pathogens that are too
virulent, and in extreme cases kill their hosts, generally have reduced
fitness since, in most situations, dead hosts do not transmit. The idea
is then that pathogens evolve to induce the level of virulence that is
optimal for their overall transmission fitness.

\#\#Introduction ID spread along \emph{connections} between infected and
uninfected hosts. Those could be very close and defined connections,
such as for sexually transmitted infections, or much less well-defined
connections, such as a shared water or air source (e.g., cholera and
influenza). If we want to account for these connections explicitly, we
need to consider a conceptual framework that moves away from the
compartmental approach. In the compartmental approach, all hosts with
given characteristics (e.g., infected children) were lumped together,
and no notion of connectivity was included. In contrast, a network
perspective explicitly considers individuals and their connections.

\#\#Network Terminology The basic building blocks of networks are
entities and their connections. Those entities go by different,
equivalent names, such as actor, node, vertex, site. Similarly, the
connections have different, equivalent names, such as edge, link, bond,
tie or connection. The different names stem from the fact that the
network framework was developed independently in various scientific
sub-fields.

\end{figure}

\#\#Network Nodes Usually, the nodes are individual hosts (e.g.,
humans). But that does not have to be the case. Nodes can also represent
entities such as schools, cities, hospitals, etc. Simple networks only
have one type of node, and more complicated networks can have different
types of nodes. For instance, humans can be connected to specific places
where they meet.

In their simplest form, nodes are only characterized by their
connections, and they don't have any other properties. In model
simulations, it is possible to give nodes features such as age, gender,
etc. and account for that when simulating ID spread.

\#\#Network Connections What constitutes a connection in a network
strongly depends on the question asked and the ID under consideration.
Sexual networks connect people that have some form of sexual contact
that was sufficient to transmit the disease in question. Similarly,
social contact networks consider contacts between individuals in a
social setting that allows for the transmission of an ID, e.g., close
contact for transmission of a respiratory disease. Proximity networks
can be built based on people frequenting the same locations. Connections
can either be simple or have characteristics, which describe the
relationship that exists between nodes. For instance, connections can
have weights, with stronger connections between people that have closer
or longer contacts. Connections can also have directions. For instance,
if we wanted to model cholera transmission and had a network of
villages, then a village upstream would have a connection pointing to
villages downstream, but not the reverse. In other words, an `infected
village' upstream can infect a downstream village, but the opposite does
not occur.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/complex-network-diagram.png}
\caption{More complex network diagram showing different types of nodes
and connections.}
\end{figure}

\#\#Network Characteristics The initial study of a network often starts
with the properties of the network itself, without considering any ID
spread (yet). One of the most important characteristics of a network is
the degree distribution of the nodes. This is simply a histogram of the
number of connections that each node has. If connections have directions
or there is more than one type of connection possible, then each one
would have a histogram.

Another network characteristic is the `shortest path length', which
measures the shortest distance of going from a particular node to some
other node. Every node has a shortest path length to every other node
(if 2 nodes are not connected because they belong to unconnected
subparts of a network, the path length is considered infinite).

Many other network characteristics exist, the field of network analysis
has proliferated in the last several years. If you want to learn more,
(Newman \protect\hyperlink{ref-newman13}{2013}) is a useful resource.
Many review articles on that topic also exist (Keeling and Eames
\protect\hyperlink{ref-keeling05}{2005}).

It is important to understand that some characteristics are attached to
individual nodes and some to the full network. For instance, every node
has a number of degrees (connections), and the network has an overall
degree distribution. Similarly, one can compute the mean shortest path
length for each node and, if one takes another mean, a mean path length
for the whole network.

\#\#Important types of networks There are several types or classes of
networks with specific characteristics that have been studied in great
detail, either because they are analytically tractable or because of
their real-world importance.

One of the best-studied networks is the random network. In this network,
any 2 nodes have a fixed probability of being connected. For a network
of \emph{N} nodes and connection probability \emph{p}, the average
number of connections each node has (it's degree) is \emph{(N-1)p}. The
degree distribution of the network is binomial, which for large networks
becomes a normal distribution. That means most nodes have approximately
the average number of connections. There are only a few nodes with
substantially fewer or more connections.

Many real-world networks do not have the degree distribution found for
random networks. It is often common that most nodes have very few
connections, while a few nodes have many connections. This idea, for
instance, underlies the superspreader concept. Such a distribution of
connections can be well described by a scale-free network. In which case
the degree distribution follows a power law, with most nodes having very
few connections but a small number of nodes having very many
connections.

\#\#ID Transmission on Networks The premise for ID transmission is that
it can only occur along the connections of a network. As such, the
structure of the network can strongly influence the dynamics of the ID.
How exactly different characteristics of networks, such as the one
discussed above and others, interact with the features of the ID to
affect overall ID dynamics is an area that is currently heavily
investigated. For some recent work on that, see (Bansal, Grenfell, and
Meyers \protect\hyperlink{ref-bansal07}{2007}).

\#\#Networks and ID Control Knowing about the connection structure is
necessary for ID control. Most obviously, if we are aware who the
individuals are with many connections, we could target them
preferentially and have a potentially larger impact compared to
targeting random people. Other individuals that connect separate
clusters of a network might also be prime targets. The challenge in
real-world systems is to identify the individuals that should be
targeted and being able to reach them, and in an outbreak situation,
that would need to be done under time pressure. As such, while network
theory has much to offer for control, it is still challenging to
implement network-based intervention approaches in practice.

\#\#Modeling ID Transmission on Networks Building and analyzing network
models of ID transmission is generally more challenging than the
compartmental modeling approach. For networks, we usually track
individuals and as such the model becomes an agent-based model caring
all the added complexity associated with agent-based modeling. It is
also somewhat harder to analyze the results. Still, networks are a much
closer approximation of real systems and have therefore seen increased
use in the ID modeling community in recent years. With an increase in
available data of the `network type' (geocoded cellphone data) further
increases in computational power and more sophisticated and efficient
analysis approaches, it is quite likely that network-based methods will
continue to grow in importance.

\#\#ID Transmission on Dynamic Networks Most of the time, networks are
considered static and do not change during the ID transmission process.
However, this does not have to be the case and is often not realistic.
The most detailed models allow for variations in the network through the
making and breaking of connections and addition and loss (birth and
death) of nodes. Implementing and analyzing models that have a
dynamically changing network with the ID dynamics (and potential control
measures) occurring `on top' is technically challenging. Not too many of
such models currently exist, but it is an area of active investigation
by many, see (Bansal et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-bansal10}{2010}).

transmission networks and how they impact dynamics and control of ID.

\#Summary

This book provided an introduction to Infectious Disease Epidemiology
from a modern, dynamical systems perspective.

While the ability to be able to develop and analyze dynamical models
requires additional training and skills in mathematics and coding, I
hope that this book helped you to understand such a systems modeling
perspective and different ID concepts best discussed from such a
perspective.

I this book, we discussed infectious diseases from a dynamical systems
perspective and made heavy use of models, both in gaining conceptual
understanding and in the exercises. Some use of software

\hypertarget{r-packages}{%
\section{R packages}\label{r-packages}}

While basic R can do some things, the main pwer of R comes from its
packages. The number of R packages keeps growing incredibly fast. The
official place for packages is the CRAN repository, but nowadays many
packages, especially those in early development, can also be found on
Github and other places. Packages give you additional sets of
functionality. For instance the `Shiny' package provides the
functionality in the DSAIDE package to have a nice graphical interface
through which to interact with the simulations. As you can tell by this,
packages can make use of each other. Similarly, most of the underlying
simulations in the DSAIDE package make use of the \emph{deSolve} package
to simulate the differential equation models. There is a package for
almost any need, and it is often common for individuals to publish a new
method together with and R package. Therefore, you can often use
cutting-edge approaches in a user-friendly manner, instead of having to
write the code yourself or wait until some commercial software has
implemented this new approach.

\hypertarget{the-r-universe}{%
\section{The `R universe'}\label{the-r-universe}}

In addition to using R for building and running models and doing all
kinds of computational tasks, there is another reason why using R is a
good choice. By now, in large part thanks to the folks from RStudio, a
whole system has emerged around R that allows you to build full products
from beginning to end in the `R Ecosystem'. The RMarkdown language
allows you to combine R code with text and quickly produce nice outputs
in various formats (e.g.~html, pdf, word). The bookdown package lets you
write whole books (in fact, this book was mainly written in bookdown).
The blogdown package lets you quickly produce blog posts with code and
text. It is easy to produce presentation slides based on a mix of code
and text. Even animated and interactive graphics are possible. This can
make your whole workflow much easier and save a lot of time. It also
helps make things reproducible.

\hypertarget{other-software}{%
\section{Other software}\label{other-software}}

The following provides a brief, non-exhaustive list of other software
used for ID modeling and analysis. These are my own, possibly biased
opinions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Python is a programming language that is similar in terms of
  difficulty to learn/use as R. Python ise is growing a lot (like R) and
  it's open source and free (like R). It comes with libraries
  (equivalent to packages in R) that provide additional functionality. I
  have never actually used Python, but I know colleagues who use it and
  it seems to me that R and Python are overall rather similar. If you
  have specific functionality you need, you might want to check if R or
  Python is better.
\item
  Matlab and Octave. Before I switched to R, I used Matlab a lot. It's
  the de-facto standard in engineering. In the engineering areas, it has
  features not found in R. When it comes to more statistical questions,
  R can often do more with the right packages. To me, the main reason
  not to use Matlab is the price. It's a commercial product and can be
  quite expensive. For both teaching and research, having access to free
  and open source software is in my opinion very important. That was the
  main reason I stopped using Matlab - and have not had the need to
  consider using it again. Octave is a free, open source implementation
  of Matlab. It's not as powerful and feature-rich as Matlab and, while
  I haven't tried Octave in a while, it seems to me that R or Python are
  better choices for the budding infectious disease modeler/analyst.
\item
  Berkeley Madonna, Stella, Nova, etc.: There are software packages,
  like these, which are meant specifically to build and simulate
  dynamical systems. One big advantage of those software compared to R
  is that they allow the user to build and run models through a
  graphical interface by drawing the model diagram and letting the
  software take care of the code. This is a great feature for those just
  starting out with modeling. I wish R had a package that would allow
  that. The downside is that once you want to do some more sophisticated
  and customized analyses, you either have to write code (using the
  language specific for those packages, which is often different than
  any other programming langauge) and/or you might just not be able to
  do what you want to do and will have to switch to a more flexible
  language (e.g.~R or Python) anyway. Further most of those sofware
  packages are not free. If you just plan on doing some fairly simple
  modeling tasks, looking at some of these packages might be worth it.
  If you plan on diving deep into modeling, I suggest you go with R or
  Python. The initial learning curve is harder, but once you mastered it
  you will have a much more powerful tool at your disposal.
\item
  SAS, SPSS, STATA, etc.: Those are commonly used to do more statistical
  and data analysis tasks. I have very limited experience with them. I
  don't like to use them for several reasons. For one, they are all
  commercial and not free. Further, they are in my opinion not `real'
  programming languages, i.e.~they are good at what they do, but if you
  need to be able to write your own bit of code to do whatever you want
  to, then you quickly reach your limits. I don't know anyone who uses
  these mainly statistical software packages for simulating dynamical
  infectious disease models. Over the years I've tried to figure out why
  one might use any of these software packages, I haven't found a
  convincing reason. They are often a bit more user friendly than
  jumping right in and coding, but there are packages for R that provide
  graphical interfaces to do statistics - for free. Unless you need to
  use them for some reason, I would stay away from them.

\chapter{Appendix B - How to build or use the right
model}\label{modelcomplexity}
>>>>>>> master

Onee might be inclined to build very complicated and detailed models, in
an effort to be as realistic as possible. While more detailed models can
indeed be more realistic, there are several drawbacks. First, as models
get larger, they contain more parameters. Each parameter needs to be
given a numeric value to allow one to run simulations. One can try to
obtain the parameters from the literature, however, often that
information is not available. Alternatively, one could fit the model to
data (something not discussed in this book) and try to estimate the
parameters. However, with the kind of data typically available, one can
usually only estimate a few parameters with some level of certainty. And
even if one were to be able to get good estimates for all model
parameters, larger models are harder to implement, take longer to run,
and are more difficult to analyze. With too many parts present, it can
be hard to understand how different components interact with each other
and affect outcomes of interest.
<<<<<<< HEAD

We therefore cannot - and do not want to - include every detail of a
complex system, i.e.~all components and interactions. We need to decide
which parts are important and need to be in the model, and which ones we
can ignore. A simple and somewhat silly example: We never include the
hair color of individuals in any infectious disease models (at least
I've never seen such a model), since we assume that this characteristic
is not important for the ID dynamics. The choice to include or exclude
other features is less obvious in other cases. For instance, for an HIV
model, we likely need gender, while a SARS model might ignore this
characteristic.

It is important to find a trade-off between details that need to be
included and details one can leave out. Unfortunately, there is no
recipe for it. Some very simple models have produced useful insights,
while there are big models in the literature that arguably do little to
nothing in helping us understand or deal with infectious diseases.
Obviously, there have also been fairly big models that have produced
useful information, and small models that are too simplistic to provide
much information about any real system.

A good analogy for model building and use in general is the use of maps.
Maps are models of the real world. They serve specific purposes, and it
is important that a given map be useful for the intended purpose. For
instance, if we want to know how to drive from Atlanta to Athens, the
left map in figure \ref{fig:mapfigure} would be most useful. If instead
we want to know where in the US the state of Georgia is located, the
middle map is most useful. If we want to know where most people live in
Georgia, the right map is most useful. In each case, we study the same
object (the state of Georgia), but depending on the question, different
maps are needed. Maps (and models) are useful because they capture the
information that is needed for a specific situation, while leaving out
unneccesary information. Nobody would want to have a map so detailed
that it is essentially the real world - it wouldn't be a very useful map
anymore.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/mapfigure.png}
\caption{\label{fig:mapfigure}Three different maps of the state of Georgia.}
\end{figure}

In analogy to the map example, we need to decide for a specific ID,
scenario, and question which details to include in our model and which
ones to ignore. In general, the primary interactions between components
of the system are needed. Thus, if we wanted to model the transmission
dynamics of Ebola, we might need to include deceased infected
individuals into the model, since they are known to contribute to
transmission. In contrast, if we want to study how some control
strategies for SARS might reduce the total number of \emph{infected} but
we don't care about the impact on total deaths (unlikely, but let's just
pretend). In this case, we would not need a dead compartment in our
model, since those dead don't further interact with anyone else in the
system. However, if we want to keep track of deaths and how they are
impacted by our intervention (likely), we do need to track them - even
though dead people are not known to transmit SARS.

To build models that are suitable to study a particular system, model
builders need to be experts on the system they want to study or
collaborate with subject matter experts. Building a good model needs to
follow the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle}{Goldilocks
Principle}: If a model is too simple, it likely doesn't approximate the
real system very well. If the model is too complicated, it is hard to
build and analyze, and might not lead to much insight (i.e.~the model is
a big black box). The goal is to get the model \emph{just right}
regarding size and complexity. Unfortunately, no recipe or formula
exists specifying how to build a \emph{just right} model. Using models
that are suitable for a given system and question is a hallmark of a
good scientist.

The model building and analysis process is often iterative. After a
model has been built and studied, it might become clear -- e.g.~by
comparing the model with data -- that important components or
interactions have been ignored or not been included correctly. This
leads to model modification and refinement. This back and forth between
model and data/the real world can happen over multiple iterations.

Note that for purposes of teaching, we keep the models throughout this
book fairly simple. The models will include the feature we are focusing
on while excluding others. For instance, we include humans and mosquitos
for vector-borne IDs but ignore things like asymptomatic or
pre-symptomatic states. This is mainly done to keep models simple and
focus on one feature at a time. Models that address ``real'' questions
often -- but not always -- include more details than the models we
investigate througout this book.

\hypertarget{overview-1}{%
\section{Overview}\label{overview-1}}

There are different ways one can categorize the uses of the mechanistic
models we discussed here. The following is one useful way of thinking
about model uses.

\hypertarget{exploringunderstanding}{%
\section{Exploring/Understanding}\label{exploringunderstanding}}

At the early stages of trying to gain a fairly basic understanding of
the behavior of a system, one can build simple mechanistic models and
explore how interactions between model components (and thus components
of the real system) impact observed patterns. Using models in this way
provides a quick and cheap way to gain some intuition of how a system
functions. For understanding purposes, one generally tries to keep
models simple.

\hypertarget{predictionwhat-if}{%
\section{Prediction/what-if}\label{predictionwhat-if}}

Once we have gained some general understanding of the system under study
and know enough about the system to be able to build models that provide
reasonable approximations of the real system, we can use those models to
perform \emph{in silico experiments}. We can make predictions what might
happen to the system if we changed some of its parts. For instance in a
model that includes some cytokine, we could test what would happen if we
administered a drug that suppressed this cytokine. This allows us to
make predictions that can be tested with further experiments. These
\emph{in silico} approaches are much faster, cheaper and have no ethical
problems, compared to real experiments. Of course the major caveat with
any model result is that it is only useful insofar as the model properly
captures the important features of the real system. The more a model is
used to make predictions and these predictions tested with data, the
more reliable it becomes.

\hypertarget{fittinginference}{%
\section{Fitting/inference}\label{fittinginference}}

The previous two ways of using a model can be considered \emph{data
free}. What we mean by that is that while models should obviously be
built based on the best information about the system, and model
parameters need to come from experiments or other data sources, once the
model is built it can be run and analyzed without further need for data.
Comparing model predictions with data, as described in the previous
paragraph, is a first step toward using data together with models. If
one makes the model-data comparison in a rigorous statistical manner,
one reaches the area of model fitting (inference). Here, one tries to
fit a specific mechanistic model to available data in a rigorous
statistical manner (using various approaches such as frequentist,
likelihood or bayesian methods). Fitting allows one to discriminate
between different postulated mechanisms (hypotheses), which are
translated into different models and fitting determines which model is
better at explaining the observed data. Further, model fitting provides
estimates for model parameters. Often, such parameters have a directly

\section{Overview}\label{overview-2}}

Throghout this book, we have tried to connect the real world and data to
models. In some chapters, we described how one can directly use data to
estimate quantities of interest (e.g.~the reproductive number chapter).
